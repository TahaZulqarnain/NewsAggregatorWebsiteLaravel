While the Escalade suffered a dent in its right rear panel, the teen\'s car was totaled.\n\n\"It had no chance against that bigger vehicle,\" Pedersen said.\n\nAfter making sure his kids were OK, Pedersen said he got out of his SUV, at first reacting as anyone would who was hit by another driver.\n\n\"Yeah, I was a little agitated there, but then I looked around,\" he told Cowboy State Daily.\n\nHe saw an upset Gracie.\n\n\"She has this parking pass for one of the high schools in her windshield, so then I know that she\'s just a kid,\" he said. \"And she\'s just dressed very nice and was on her way home from church.\"\n\nMeanwhile, it was obvious her car wouldn\'t get out of the intersection on its own.\n\n\"Her car was leaking every color fluid you can imagine and was just immovable. Totaled,\" he said. \"Then I was feeling, like, accidents happen. Every person, every year in all our lives we brake a little too late driving somewhere. It just happened on ice for her this time.\"\n\nPedersen also was impressed with how Gracie handled the situation. Although visibly upset and shaky, the teen showed a lot of maturity and compassion, he said.\n\n\"She was in tears because she felt terrible that she had run into somebody,\" Pedersen said. \"Then you start thinking about what a car represents to someone like her -- growing up, independence, working for something.\n\n\"But she was immediately concerned for us. Her first question was, \'Is everyone OK?\' She\'s much more put together than I was at that age. That was not me when I was 17.\"\n\nThat\'s when Pedersen said his thoughts turned to not being agitated that some inexperienced teen driver had run into him, but how he could help her.\n\nHe put out some feelers to some friends and, along with a few thousand dollars of his own, quickly raised nearly $15,000 to buy Gracie another car.\n\n\"I knew she could never just go out and replace the one that was totaled,\" he said.\n\nBesides, Pedersen felt she had earned some goodwill and is a great candidate to someday down the road pay it forward.\n\n\"I was thinking about it all and asked around about her,\" he said. \"Turns out, she\'s a 4.0 student in high school, she\'s going to graduate early and major in physics (in college). She\'s just a good kid in her school.\n\n\"She also works for a local hardware store and paid for that car herself. Yeah, she had hit us, but I felt I had a moral responsibility to help her as I could.\"\n\nIt didn\'t take long.\n\nAfter putting out a plea to his friends on Facebook, \"Money started pouring in,\" he said. \"We finally raised enough, and I started shopping for what\'s available.\"\n\nHe found a low-milage 2018 Ford Echo, red, and recently presented the car to Gracie, who was totally surprised.\n\n\"I didn\'t even know what to say, I didn\'t know what to do,\" she told CBS Mornings host David Begnaud for his \"Dear David\" segment of the show that aired Monday. \"It\'s such a huge gift, obviously, I didn\'t know how to express how much it really meant.\"\n\nThe story of Pedersen and Gracie caught the attention of Linda Gullicks of Cheyenne, who wrote to CBS Mornings about the unusual act of kindness.\n\nWhile Gracie is a little overwhelmed by the attention the national television story has brought, it\'s one Pedersen said shouldn\'t be about him. It\'s about a good, upstanding young woman who needed a break. And he felt obligated to give it to her.\n\n\"Yes, she had hit us, but I felt I had a moral responsibility to help her as I could,\" he said. \"It\'s an opportunity to continue on in her life moving forward.\n\n\"She\'s such a good kid and deserves to keep on with her goals in life and not have this be a moment that diverts her life into a different outcome.\"\n\nGracie told CBS that the outcome was certainly different from the moment she hit that patch of ice and realized she couldn\'t do anything to stop the crash.\n\n\"I had no control of my car whatsoever. I felt helpless,\" she said, adding it took a few moments to realize her car was totaled. \"It was, like, something I worked really hard for and something I wanted to use so that I didn\'t have to trouble others for, like, rides to work (and) rides to school.\"\n\nPedersen said people talk a lot about paying if forward, but for at least one young person, he\'s confident the message will become a habit.\n\n\"She asked me, what can we do to help pay this forward?\" he said. \"I told her that sometime over the next 20 years, an opportunity will present itself. You\'ll know it when you see it, and then you can help someone.\"', 'https://cowboystatedaily.imgix.net/Bryan-Pederson-and-Gracie-7.13.25.jpg', 'https://cowboystatedaily.com/2025/07/13/a-teen-driver-hit-his-car-so-cheyenne-man-bought-her-a-new-one/', 'cowboystatedaily.com', NULL, NULL, '2025-07-13 15:14:01', '2025-07-13 15:24:32', '2025-07-13 15:24:32'),

Not so much a turn up for the books, more a Gotterup for them?\n\nHopelessly contrived article introductions aside, this was a wonderful win for Chris Gotterup as the 25-year-old American, who was ranked 158th in the world at the start of the week, claimed the biggest title of his career.\n\nHaving stood firm to stave off a chasing pack that included the Masters champion and world No 2, Rory McIlroy, Gotterup could allow himself a wobble at the end.\n\n\"I\'m not going to be able to keep it together,\" he said with a tear in his eye as the magnitude of the moment began to sink in.\n\nAs well as the coveted title -- and a check for some $1.5 million -- Gotterup also earned a spot in this week\'s Open Championship at Royal Portrush. It was a decent day\'s work.\n\nHis canny, composed 4-under 66 gave him a 15-under total and a two-shot victory over McIlroy and the spirited Englishman, Marco Penge.\n\n\"I definitely was the villain out there today,\" Gotterup added with a smile. \"There were a lot of cries of \'Rory\' and not many of \'Chris\'.\"\n\nIn the heat of the battle, Gotterup also had to contend with a warning from an official for slow play.\n\n\"[Our group] got warned on 13 for pace, which was a little odd because we were waiting all day,\" he said. \"Then on 15, I got individually timed, which was shocking. That got my blood going a little bit more than it was already going trying to win a golf tournament.\"\n\nNobody said winning was easy. At one stage of the afternoon, there were five players tied at the top.\n\nIn addition to McIlroy, the emergence on the leaderboard of the likes of Matthew Fitzpatrick, Justin Rose, Xander Schauffele, Viktor Hovland and World No 1, Scottie Scheffler, should\'ve been accompanied by the kind of ominous rumbling you\'d hear when heavy artillery gets maneuvered into a strategic position.\n\nGotterup was up for the fight, though. Well, after an initial misfire. \"I hit it in the bunker on the first hole and was like, \'oh, s**t, here we go,\" said Gotterup who was sharing the lead with McIlroy heading into the final round.\n\nThat early diversion into the sand didn\'t alter his course and his tenacious efforts kept him right in the thick of it.\n\nMcIlroy seemed to be taking charge as he moved to the front with a trio of birdies on the front nine but after a 20-footer on the eighth, those birdies dried up.\n\nThe 2023 Scottish Open champion didn\'t make another over his last 10 holes.\n\nBy the 12th, Gotterup was two clear of the pack. He missed a good chance to extend that on 13 then stumbled to a bogey on the next. The door was still ajar.\n\nGotterup, though, remained as sturdy as the rock of Fidra Island and a birdie on 16 pushed him towards a mighty triumph.\n\nThe Maryland man had been planning to fly to the west coast of America for a PGA Tour event this week. Instead, he\'s nipping over to Northern Ireland for an Open debut.\n\n\"I\'m happy I\'m not flying from here to California,\" he said as he cancelled those transatlantic flights.\n\nGotterup, who will now vault into the world\'s top-50, made his breakthrough on the PGA Tour at Myrtle Beach last season. This win, though, is on a different level.\n\n\"A lot of people say that the second one is harder just because you have expectations and whatnot,\" he said. \"It\'s definitely more a validation this week. Myrtle Beach was amazing, but this one is the next step.\n\n\"I knew today was going to be a battle and Rory is one of the best to ever do it. I\'m happy I edged him out.\"\n\nDespite the disappointment of defeat, McIlroy will head to the Open in his homeland with a spring in his step.\n\n\"I\'m really happy with where my game is,\" he said. \"I gave myself plenty of chances coming down the stretch. But Chris played a great round of golf and I just couldn\'t claw it back.\"\n\nPenge, the winner of the Scottish Amateur Open Strokeplay Championship a decade ago, deserved great credit for a dogged 66 while Fitzpatrick\'s return to form continued with a round that included an eagle from 35-feet on the 10th in a 67 as the former U.S. Open champion shared fourth with the fast-finishing Nicolai Hojgaard.\n\nNobody finished faster, meanwhile, than Justin Rose, as the Ryder Cup stalwart came barging up the standings with a delightfully assembled 7-under 63 which left him in a share of sixth at 11 under.\n\n\"I felt a round like that has been out there for me this week,\" said Rose.\n\nThe ultimate prize, and the plaudits, belonged to Gotterup.', 'https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/OGuZvGWdEyzLGXdXUIAlzw--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyMDA7aD04MDU7Y2Y9d2VicA--/https://media.zenfs.com/en/usa_today_sports_golfweek_articles_635/8577f5d5479bc055203226e3d0be8de8', 'https://sports.yahoo.com/article/chris-gotterup-upstages-rory-mcilroy-200819262.html', 'Yahoo Sports', NULL, NULL, '2025-07-13 15:08:19', '2025-07-13 15:24:33', '2025-07-13 15:24:33'),

Another issue was that Alcaraz\'s serving, while speedy, was spotty.\n\nYes, there were 15 aces, but there also were seven double-faults. His first-serve percentage was just 53%. He was broken a total of five times, at least once per set.\n\nOne particular problem was his second serve, because Sinner was hammering returns on those slower offerings.\n\nThat left Alcaraz on the defensive too often.\n\n\"Today was complicated, a little bit,\" Alcaraz said, crediting Sinner with being \"one of the best returners on tour, without a doubt.\"\n\n\"I mean, with the nerves and everything, it was difficult to serve better,\" Alcaraz said. \"I just have to improve that, absolutely.\"\n\nHe also acknowledged that if he had a dip in form, it was caused more by Sinner than any sort of fatigue.\n\n\"He was pushing me to the limit on every point. So mentally, sometimes, it\'s really tough to maintain the good focus or the good level during the whole match when you see the opponent just playing such a great tennis,\" Alcaraz said. \"At some points, I didn\'t know what I had to do in the match, because from the baseline, I was feeling he was better than me, and I couldn\'t do anything about it.\"\n\n___\n\nHoward Fendrich has been the AP\'s tennis writer since 2002.

(41, 'Administration, congressional GOP looks to gut weather science, reduce disaster response', 'Lisa Friedman, Maxine Joselow, Coral Davenport and Megan Mineiro New York Times\n\nIn an effort to shrink the federal government, President Donald Trump and congressional Republicans have taken steps that are diluting the country\'s ability to anticipate, pr', 'Lisa Friedman, Maxine Joselow, Coral Davenport and Megan Mineiro New York Times\n\nIn an effort to shrink the federal government, President Donald Trump and congressional Republicans have taken steps that are diluting the country\'s ability to anticipate, prepare for and respond to catastrophic flooding and other extreme weather events, disaster experts say.\n\nStaff reductions, budget cuts and other changes made by the administration since January have already created holes at the National Weather Service, which forecasts and warns of dangerous weather.\n\nTrump\'s budget proposal for the next fiscal year would close 10 laboratories run by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration that research the ways a warming planet is changing weather, among other things. That work is essential to more accurately predicting life-threatening hazards. Among the shuttered labs would be one in Miami that sends teams of \"hurricane hunters\" to fly into storms to collect critical data. The proposed budget would also make major cuts to a federal program that uses river gauges to predict floods.\n\nThe president is also envisioning a dramatically scaled-down Federal Emergency Management Agency that would shift the costs of disaster response and recovery from the federal government to the states. The administration has already revoked $3.6 billion in grants from FEMA to hundreds of communities around the country, which were to be used to help these areas protect against hurricanes, wildfires and other catastrophes. About 10% of the agency\'s staff members have left since January, including senior leaders with decades of experience, and another 20% are expected to be gone by the end of this year.\n\nThe White House and agency leaders say they are making much-needed changes to bloated bureaucracies that no longer serve the American public well.\n\nFEMA, for one, \"has been slow to respond at the federal level. It\'s even been slower to get the resources to Americans in crisis,\" Kristi Noem, the homeland security secretary, said last week at a meeting convened by the president to recommend changes to the agency. \"That is why this entire agency needs to be eliminated as it exists today and remade into a responsive agency. We owe it to all the American people to deliver the most efficient and the most effective disaster response.\"\n\nNational security and disaster management experts agreed that FEMA -- or any federal agency -- could be improved but said the chaotic changes the Trump administration is making to FEMA, as well as other parts of the government, are harmful.\n\nThe federal government\'s retrenchment arrives at a time when climate change is making extreme weather more frequent and severe. Last year, the United States experienced 27 disasters that cost more than $1 billion each.\n\nA \'Generational Loss\' for Forecasting\n\nFor months, experts have warned that cuts to the National Weather Service, part of NOAA, could endanger local communities. Those fears have grown since the deadly flash floods in central Texas earlier this month.\n\nBy all accounts, the weather service issued the appropriate warnings for the region that was inundated by the Guadalupe River on July 4.\n\nBut the agency had to move employees from other offices to temporarily staff the San Antonio office that handled the flood warnings, and the office lacked a warning coordination meteorologist, whose job it is to communicate with local emergency managers to plan for floods, including when and how to warn residents and help them evacuate. The office\'s warning coordination meteorologist had left April 30, after taking the early retirement package the Trump administration has offered to reduce the number of federal employees.\n\nSince Trump took office, the weather service has shed about 600 jobs from its workforce of roughly 4,200 people. They are part of a greater exodus of nearly 2,000 employees from NOAA. Nearly half of the weather service\'s 122 forecast offices had lost at least 20% of their staff as of April. Thirty offices were lacking their most experienced official, known as the meteorologist-in-charge, as of May.\n\n\"When that position is vacant, it does have consequences because that is the primary person who is briefing elected officials and emergency managers,\" said Brian LaMarre, who retired at the end of April as the meteorologist-in-charge of the weather service forecast office in Tampa, Florida.\n\nSome forecast offices are no longer staffed overnight, and others have been launching fewer weather balloons, which send data to feed forecasts. The weather service has said it is preparing for \"degraded operations.\"\n\nThe president is preparing to deal another blow to weather forecasting in his spending plan for next year, which would cut funding for NOAA by another $2 billion, or 27%. On the chopping block would be the agency\'s entire scientific research division, one of the world\'s premier weather and climate research centers, preventing the creation of new weather forecasting technologies.\n\nTen laboratories across the country are also slated to be closed, including the National Severe Storms Laboratory in Norman, Oklahoma. Founded in 1964, the lab created a tool to improve the accuracy of flash flood forecasts across the country -- the same tool that correctly predicted the Guadalupe River\'s rise after the floods hit central Texas.\n\nTrump also wants to shutter the Atlantic Oceanographic and Meteorological Laboratory in Miami, which deploys \"hurricane hunters,\" or specialized aircraft and crew members who fly directly into storms to collect critical data like wind speed, temperature and humidity. Forecasters use this data to predict a storm\'s intensity and where it is likely to make landfall.\n\n\"The proposed NOAA cuts would mean a generational loss in hurricane forecasting,\" said Michael Lowry, a hurricane specialist and meteorologist for WPLG Local 10 News in Miami.\n\nTrump\'s sweeping domestic policy and tax law, which Congress passed this month, also rescinds about $60 million in unspent funds at NOAA for atmospheric, climate and weather research. That money had been part of the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act, the Biden administration\'s signature climate law.\n\nAt the National Aeronautics and Space Administration, Trump wants to halve funding for earth science and terminate satellites that have been collecting data on the atmosphere, ocean, land and ice for more than two decades.\n\nThese cuts could bring about a \"train wreck\" for weather forecasting, said William B. Gail, a former president of the American Meteorological Society.\n\nReducing the Ability to Monitor Floods\n\nThe United States Geological Survey operates about 8,000 gauges in rivers, streams and other bodies of water, gathering data from across the country to help communities monitor and plan for floods.\n\nThe gauges automatically transmit information every 15 minutes by satellite, sending real-time data that forms the basis for flood alerts that are sent to phones, as well as forecasts made by the National Weather Service. The gauges showed the 28-foot surge in floodwater on the Guadalupe River in the early morning of July 5.\n\nTrump\'s 2026 budget proposal would cut 22% from the USGS water resources program that includes the network of gauges. It argues that the plan \"maintains support for stream gauges\" but would increase the use of artificial intelligence to analyze the data.\n\nThe \'Demolition\' of Disaster Response?\n\nFEMA is the backbone of the nation\'s emergency response resources, but disaster experts have for many years said the agency needs to be streamlined to deliver help to survivors more efficiently. Trump has said he wants to \"phase out\" FEMA and shift more responsibility -- and costs -- to the states.\n\nThe Trump administration has already begun significantly scaling back the agency, eliminating billions of dollars in grants that help communities prepare for extreme weather.\n\nIn addition to freezing $3.6 billion of unspent funds that had been approved for states, the administration stopped approving new grants that since the 1980s have been used to elevate or demolish flood-prone homes and strengthen buildings in hurricane zones.\n\nThe president\'s proposed 2026 budget eliminates about $882 million in the Building Resilient Infrastructure and Communities grant program, which helped support resources including flood control systems, wildfire prevention and stormwater management upgrades. The Trump administration called the program \"wasteful and ineffective.\"\n\nFEMA has lost about a quarter of its full-time staff in the past six months, including 20% of the coordinating officers at the agency, who manage responses to major disasters, as well as the head of FEMA\'s disaster command center. Also gone: the deputy regional administrator in the agency\'s Region 6 office in Texas.\n\nDavid Richardson, FEMA\'s acting head, has no emergency management experience.\n\n\"We are not witnessing a reimagining of federal disaster response -- we are watching its demolition,\" Mary Ann Tierney, who resigned recently as the acting deputy secretary of the Department of Homeland Security, said in an interview. \"With each policy rollback and staffing cut, the federal disaster management function is being hollowed out, leaving states and survivors to face storms, fires and floods with less.\"', 'https://thumb.spokesman.com/X2X3sGbBa8cFULNo5UWM1AH6zt8=/1200x630/smart/media.spokesman.com/photos/2025/07/13/6874122ab56b0.hires.jpg', 'https://www.spokesman.com/stories/2025/jul/13/administration-congressional-gop-looks-to-gut-weat/', 'The Spokesman Review', NULL, NULL, '2025-07-13 14:38:00', '2025-07-13 15:24:33', '2025-07-13 15:24:33'),

A few millimeters to the left and history would have been changed dreadfully for the worse.\n\n\'I saw the President get hit and go down,\' recalled Senator McCormick in an exclusive interview with Daily Mail. \'I saw the Secret Service pile on top of him.

But a year on from the attempted assassination of President Trump by 20-year-old gunman, Thomas Crooks, even Senator McCormick - a Pennsylvania senator, who witnessed it all and has as much desire as anyone for answers - still does not know how this was allowed to happened.\n\n\'I\'m not a conspiracy theorist,\' Senator McCormick told the Daily Mail. \'I don\'t have some grand theory of how this came about. But Americans deserve better, more coherent answers to how this could have occurred, because the consequences of it could have been so significant.\'\n\nA Congressional committee in December published a detailed report into the Secret Service\'s failings that day. But the investigators did not look into the motivations or preparations of Crooks, who was shot dead after firing eight shots in six seconds.\n\nCrooks missed the president but his shots struck and killed Corey Comperatore, a 50-year-old fire chief of Buffalo Township, who was sitting on the rally stage.\n\nMinutes before the senator was due to join the president, Trump changed his mind and decided that he first wanted to show the rally crowd a chart depicting the scope of the illegal immigration crisis unleashed by then-President Joe Biden\n\nTwo other attendees, David Dutch and James Copenhaver, were injured.\n\nThe director of the Secret Service, Kimberly Cheatle, resigned ten days after the July 13 shooting. This week, the six Secret Service agents assigned to protect Trump that day were suspended. Their names have not been revealed. And no one else has been held accountable for the failures.\n\nWisconsin Senator Ron Johnson, who chairs the Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations, and was a co-author of the December report on the assassination attempt, is seeking further answers, but claims he is being \'stonewalled\'.\n\nOn Thursday, Johnson approved a subpoena to secure more information from the FBI and Department of Justice - both of which are now headed by Trump loyalists who have long vowed to shine a light on the so-called secrets of the deep state.\n\nThe apparent inability to secure answers from the Trump administration intelligence community baffles him.\n\n\'Everybody else seems to have been moving on here and not particularly interested in an investigation. I am,\' Johnson said. \'I\'m moving forward, which is why I approved a subpoena.\'\n\nBoth Mike Kelly, the Pennsylvania representative who chaired the special House task force investigating the attempt, and Jason Crow, the top Democrat on the committee, stressed their work address the mistakes the lead to the shooting. But they don\'t claim to have all the answers either.\n\n\'In the year since the attempted assassination of President Trump, Congress has taken significant steps to investigate the events of July 13,\' said Kelly. \'Our Task Force produced nearly 40 recommendations to modernize the Secret Service and to better protect America\'s leaders.\'\n\nA year on from the attempted assassination of President Trump by 20-year-old gunman, Thomas Crooks (pictured), even Senator McCormick - who witnessed it all and has as much desire as anyone for answers - still does not know how this was allowed to happened\n\nCrooks was shot dead at the scene after firing eight shots in six seconds, missing the president but killed Corey Comperatore (pictured), the 50-year-old fire chief of Buffalo Township\n\nA Congressional committee in December published a detailed report into the Secret Service\'s failings that day. But the investigators did not look into the motivations and preparations of the Crooks. (Pictured: The empty rally site after Trump was nearly shot)\n\nBut he admitted that he, \'like many in the Butler community\', was still searching for answers.\n\n\'I still have questions about everything that led up to, and unfolded on, July 13. May we continue to pursue the truth to get the American people the answers they deserve.\'\n\nMarjorie Taylor Greene, a representative from Georgia, told the Daily Mail that it was \'unforgivable\' that Americans know so little about that day and, specifically, the gunman.\n\n\'Still to this day, we know absolutely nothing about the young man that shot President Trump at a rally in Butler, Pennsylvania a year ago,\' claimed Greene.\n\n\'It\'s just a betrayal of President Trump and all the people that voted for him,\' she said.\n\nJohn Fetterman, senator for Pennsylvania, echoed Greene\'s calls for more information to be released.\n\n\'I do not believe that there\'s like a conspiracy to withhold any information on him, but of course, I would want all of the facts on that,\' he told the Daily Mail. \'I fully support that. Thank God the president was not fatally hit... I can\'t imagine the way our nation would be if he was killed.\'\n\nWhile some information about Crooks is known, key questions remain unanswered.\n\nHis father and sister were both Libertarians; his mother was a Democrat. Crooks himself, his father said, would discuss both Trump and Joe Biden but showed no particular sentiment either way.\n\nCrooks was said by his father (pictured) to be acting erratically in the year leading up to the shooting - dancing alone in his bedroom at night and talking to himself with dramatic hand gestures\n\nHe was said by his father to be acting erratically in the year leading up to the shooting - dancing alone in his bedroom at night and talking to himself with dramatic hand gestures.\n\nCrooks\'s internet search history revealed he had looked up \'DNC convention\' and \'when is the RNC in 2024,\' the FBI confirmed. He also sought articles on Trump, Biden and guns.\n\nFrom the summer of 2023 onwards, Crooks begun using encrypted email and VPN systems that disguised his online activity. And it is still not publicly known what he was searching for during that period.\n\nCrooks made dozens of \'gun-related\' purchases using aliases online and bought chemicals to construct explosive which he hid in his bedroom, but his parents thought little of their curious, academically-gifted son, who wanted to become an engineer.\n\nThere is no evidence that Crooks had any accomplices, but the potential encryption of his communications makes that difficult.\n\nAnd, indeed, the great looming question is: Why did he do it?\n\n\'Motive is just one part of the many questions I think that we still have,\' said Senator McCormick.', 'https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2025/07/13/19/100272563-0-image-m-80_1752432127695.jpg', 'https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-14901383/Trump-Butler-senator-McCormick-thomas-crooks.html', 'Daily Mail Online', NULL, NULL, '2025-07-13 15:18:51', '2025-07-13 15:24:33', '2025-07-13 15:24:33'),

It said confrontations between Palestinians and settlers broke out after Palestinians threw rocks at Israelis, lightly injuring them.\n\n\'BETRAYAL\'\n\nMusallet\'s family said medics tried to reach him for three hours before his brother managed to carry him to an ambulance, but he died before reaching the hospital.\n\nLocal resident Domi, 18, who has lived in Al-Mazr\'a Ash-Sharqiya for the last four years after moving back from the United States, said fears had spread in the community since Friday and his parents had discussed sending him to the United States.\n\n\"If people have sons like this they are going to want to send them back to America because it\'s just not safe for them,\" he said.\n\nHe had mixed feelings about returning, saying he wanted to stay near his family\'s land, which they had farmed for generations, and that Washington should do more to protect Palestinians in the West Bank.\n\n\"It\'s a kind of betrayal,\" he said.\n\nSettler violence in the West Bank has risen since the start of Israel\'s war against Palestinian militant group Hamas in Gaza in late 2023, according to rights groups.\n\nDozens of Israelis have also been killed in Palestinian street attacks in recent years and the Israeli military has intensified raids across the West Bank.\n\nAround 700,000 Israeli settlers live among 2.7 million Palestinians in the West Bank and East Jerusalem, territories Israel captured from Jordan in the 1967 war.\n\nU.S. President Donald Trump in January rescinded sanctions imposed by the former Biden administration on Israeli settler groups and individuals accused of being involved in violence against Palestinians in the West Bank.\n\nMalik, 18, who used to visit Musallet\'s ice-cream shop in Tampa and had returned to the West Bank for a few months\' vacation, said his friend\'s death had made him question his sense of belonging.\n\n\"I was born and raised in America, I only come here two months of a 12-month year, if I die like that nobody\'s going to be charged for my murder,\" he said, standing in the cemetery shortly before his friend was buried. \"No one\'s going to be held accountable.\" REUTERS', 'https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/03f5edf4d9e2a7f7f809c5180ee20a7a5670e3883d7d218717fee353fd93553c', 'https://www.straitstimes.com/world/middle-east/anger-turns-towards-washington-in-west-bank-town-mourning-two-men-killed-by-settlers', 'The Straits Times', NULL, NULL, '2025-07-13 15:21:35', '2025-07-13 15:24:34', '2025-07-13 15:24:34'),

From divine⁤ pronouncements too the efficacy of prayer in the face of real-world crises, our readers didn\'t hold back. Let\'s dive into the highlights that earned a spot ⁢in our weekly roundup.\n\nWe kick off with a comment that boldly declares a political figure as a divine gift.While the sentiment is certainly strong, it also highlights a common theme of⁢ unwavering loyalty that frequently enough bypasses critical analysis.\n\n\"trump ⁢is a gift from God, the new messiah, and anyone who opposes him in any way is wrong.\"\n\nThis kind of absolute devotion, while a powerful expression of belief for some, frequently enough leaves little ⁢room for nuanced discussion or accountability. It\'s a sentiment that, for better or worse, shapes a significant portion of political discourse.\n\nIn second place, we revisit a post discussing the⁤ fallout from DOGE cuts and their devastating impact in⁣ Texas. The government\'s response, or lack thereof, was a focal point, and one commenter, Pixelation, offered a particularly pointed⁢ observation about the familiar practice of deflecting blame.\n\n\"I read what Trump said, I was SHOCKED to learn that it ⁤was Biden\'s fault!\"\n\nThis quip perfectly captures the frequently enough-predictable ⁤political theater where responsibility is a hot potato, constantly being passed from one administration to⁤ another, especially in the wake of tragedy. It\'s a commentary on how political narratives can sometimes overshadow the actual issues at hand.\n\nFor our editor\'s choice, we\'re focusing on the lighter, yet ⁤still incisive, side of commentary, specifically tackling the ubiquitous \"thoughts and prayers\" offered after disasters.\n\nFirst ⁢up, That One guy shared ⁤a rather ingenious, albeit⁤ satirical, proposal for a trade-off involving prayers and actual resources.\n\n\"\'Nothing could be done\', says person who did ⁢nothing.\n\n>\n\nIf prayers are so powerful for republicans how about a deal?\n\n>\n\nThe obscenely rich get⁤ \'thoughts and prayers\' going forward, and everyone else gets⁢ all that useless \'money\' for things like public safety and assistance programs.\n\n>\n\nI know it\'ll be hard⁣ for the public to lose out on the highly valuable \'thoughts and prayers\' while being left with only millions/billions of funding, but as the republicans just showed the way⁣ to make america great is to do everything possible to help the peopel who need help the⁤ least, with the expectations that they\'ll then lift everyone else with them.\"\n\nThis comment cleverly highlights the perceived disconnect between⁢ the spiritual comfort offered and the tangible needs of communities facing crises. The idea⁢ of trading \"thoughts and prayers\" for actual funding is a sharp critique of ⁢policies that seem to prioritize the wealthy over public welfare.\n\nan anonymous commenter proposed an even more absurd, yet fitting, solution to the perceived surplus of prayers:\n\n\"So, what is missing is a Department Of Prayer Efficiency.\n\nMusk, any spare time to lead this?\"\n\nThis⁣ suggestion, by ⁢humorously suggesting a bureaucratic approach to something as intangible as prayer, underscores the frustration with superficial responses to serious problems. it\'s a witty jab at the idea that more of the same, even if it\'s ⁢\"thoughts and prayers,\" is somehow ⁣a solution.That wraps up another week of insightful and often hilarious commentary from the Techdirt community.

The park initially was managing it as a controlled burn but then shifted to suppression as it rapidly grew to 7.8 square miles (20 square kilometers) because of hot temperatures, low humidity and wind, fire officials said.\n\nNo injuries have been reported.\n\nMillions of people visit Grand Canyon National Park annually, with most going to the more popular South Rim. The North Rim is open seasonally. It was evacuated last Thursday because of wildfire.\n\nFirefighters at the North Rim and hikers in the inner canyon were evacuated over the weekend. The park said along with the fire risk, they could potentially be exposed to chlorine gas after the treatment plant burned. Chlorine gas is heavier than air and can lead to blurred vision, irritation or respiratory problems if high amounts of it are breathed in, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\n\nRafters on the Colorado River through the Grand Canyon also were told to bypass Phantom Ranch, which has a set of cabins and dormitories along the river.\n\nThe North Rim lodge was often the first prominent feature that visitors see, even before viewing the canyon.

The park initially was managing it as a controlled burn but then shifted to suppression as it rapidly grew to 7.8 square miles (20 square kilometers) because of hot temperatures, low humidity and wind, fire officials said.\n\nNo injuries have been reported.\n\nMillions of people visit Grand Canyon National Park annually, with most going to the more popular South Rim. The North Rim is open seasonally. It was evacuated last Thursday because of wildfire.\n\nFirefighters at the North Rim and hikers in the inner canyon were evacuated over the weekend. The park said along with the fire risk, they could potentially be exposed to chlorine gas after the treatment plant burned. Chlorine gas is heavier than air and can lead to blurred vision, irritation or respiratory problems if high amounts of it are breathed in, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\n\nRafters on the Colorado River through the Grand Canyon also were told to bypass Phantom Ranch, which has a set of cabins and dormitories along the river.\n\nThe North Rim lodge was often the first prominent feature that visitors see, even before viewing the canyon. A highway ends at the lodge, which was known for its sloped roof, huge ponderosa beams and massive limestone facade. By walking across the lobby and descending a stairwell, visitors could get their first view of the Grand Canyon shining through windows across the \"Sun Room.\"\n\nMeanwhile, officials reported progress in battling a second wildfire burning north of the Grand Canyon. Fire lines on the White Sage Fire that forced evacuations at the North Rim and in the community of Jacob Lake were holding, officials said. On the southern edge of the fire, hand crews and bulldozers were working uphill, and the spread of the blaze had been minimal.\n\nBut to the east and north, the fire has spread rapidly, with grasses and standing dead trees contributing to the fire\'s intensity, officials said. The fire was pushing downhill toward the Vermilion Cliffs area, and crews were assessing opportunities to create buffer zones that help slow or halt the fire\'s progress.', 'https://ewscripps.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/ca631d9/2147483647/strip/true/crop/1024x576+0+117/resize/1200x675!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fewscripps.brightspotcdn.com%2Fe3%2Fb1%2F8f75d3554a48bc9c083af145c76e%2Fap25192811484801.jpg', 'https://www.fox13now.com/us-news/an-official-says-a-historic-grand-canyon-lodge-has-been-destroyed-by-wildfire', 'KSTU', NULL, NULL, '2025-07-13 15:11:17', '2025-07-13 15:24:34', '2025-07-13 15:24:34'),

He was broken a total of five times, at least once per set.\n\nOne particular problem was his second serve, because Sinner was hammering returns on those slower offerings.\n\nThat left Alcaraz on the defensive too often.\n\n\"Today was complicated, a little bit,\" Alcaraz said, crediting Sinner with being \"one of the best returners on tour, without a doubt.\"\n\n\"I mean, with the nerves and everything, it was difficult to serve better,\" Alcaraz said. \"I just have to improve that, absolutely.\"\n\nHe also acknowledged that if he had a dip in form, it was caused more by Sinner than any sort of fatigue.\n\n\"He was pushing me to the limit on every point. So mentally, sometimes, it\'s really tough to maintain the good focus or the good level during the whole match when you see the opponent just playing such a great tennis,\" Alcaraz said. \"At some points, I didn\'t know what I had to do in the match, because from the baseline, I was feeling he was better than me, and I couldn\'t do anything about it.\"\n\n___\n\nHoward Fendrich has been the AP\'s tennis writer since 2002.

The reported conditions inside this so-called \"internment camp\" elicited a strong condemnation from Democrats, who decried it as an unsanitary, dangerous political setup.\n\nA \"Charade\" Amidst Mosquitoes, Heat, and Infested Mattresses\n\nDuring a guided tour, the group was led by Kevin Guthrie, the head of Florida\'s Division of Emergency Management (FDEM), which oversees the facility. The visit, described by some lawmakers as \"sanitized\" and \"limited,\" did not allow them to speak with detainees or staff. Democratic Senator Carlos Smith, among those outraged, called for the facility\'s immediate closure. State Representative Anna Eskamani from Orlando criticized the lack of transparency regarding the rules and procedures governing detainees\' rights and statuses, as reported by Florida Phoenix.\n\nThe tour revealed insect-infested mattresses, showers and toilets lacking privacy, temperatures in purportedly climate-controlled areas reaching 83 to 85 degrees, and inadequate food portions. Representative Debbie Wasserman Schultz (FL-25) described the conditions as \"really disturbing and vile,\" urging for the facility\'s closure.\n\nLater, she took to social media to express her discontent: \"Even during a limited, sanitized visit, it was evident: this is an internment camp. Our taxpayers\' money is being squandered to cruelly cage human beings.\"\n\nOvercrowding and Dehumanizing Conditions\n\nDemocratic lawmakers noted that 32 men are crammed into each cage, sleeping on basic bunks and sharing three toilets with integrated sinks. \"They drink and brush their teeth in the same place they defecate,\" Wasserman Schultz reported. With 750 individuals confined in cages, the lawmakers were not allowed to interact with them or enter occupied areas. State Senator Carlos Guillermo Smith highlighted the presence of non-criminal immigrants among the detainees.\n\nLegislators like Maxwell Alejandro Frost (FL-10) reported hearing detainees shout from the tents, with one yelling, \"I\'m an American citizen!\" while others chanted \"Freedom!\" Frost also mentioned clogged toilets and \"feces strewn everywhere.\" He emphasized the collective shame this situation should invoke across political lines, stating, \"Immigrants aren\'t the poison in this nation\'s blood; they are its lifeblood.\"\n\nRepresentative Darren Soto (FL-9) criticized the $500 million expenditure and warned of potential flood hazards. He described the facility as a \"dangerous, wasteful political stunt\" that jeopardizes not only migrants but also federal agents and the National Guard.\n\nA Risky and Costly Endeavor\n\nConstructed in merely eight days on the old Dade-Collier Training and Transition Airport\'s runway, the center started receiving detainees on July 2, according to Florida Attorney General James Uthmeier. Government reactions have been defensive; State Senator Blaise Ingoglia, an ally of Governor DeSantis, dismissed criticisms as \"political theater,\" claiming he found the beds comfortable. Republican Senator Jay Collins also defended the center, stating it was \"clean and functioning well.\"\n\nOriginally coined by Republicans, the term \"Alligator Alcatraz\" has been ironically adopted by critics as a symbol of abuse.\n\nInstitutional Debate and Future Outlook\n\nHomeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem defended the conditions at a Tampa conference, asserting that all existing issues have been resolved and lauding the facility as a \"fantastic resource.\" She revealed that five Republican governors have shown interest in replicating the model, without naming them. Democratic Representative Jared Moskowitz, a former FDEM director, offered a more nuanced view, stating that while dire, the facility is not comparable to concentration camps.\n\nThe Archdiocese of Miami has labeled the center \"corrosive\" and \"inappropriate,\" joining the chorus demanding its immediate closure.', 'https://cdn0.celebritax.com/sites/default/files/styles/watermark_100/public/1752427735-congresistas-democratas-escandalizados-tras-primera-visita-alligator-alcatraz-fue.jpg', 'https://www.cubaheadlines.com/articles/306946', 'Cuba Headlines Digital Edition', NULL, NULL, '2025-07-13 15:21:04', '2025-07-13 15:24:35', '2025-07-13 15:24:35'),

The Labour-led government has initiated a public consultation on introducing a new Code of Practice for private parking firms.\n\nThe government is inviting road users, motorists, and drivers to share their opinions on the proposed Code of Practice, which aims to implement mandatory standards across England, Scotland, and Wales, reports Birmingham Live. The consultation, running until September 5, includes the establishment of an independent Scrutiny and Oversight Board to assess industry practices, leveraging improved data collection requirements.\n\nThe proposed Code maintains the existing £100 parking charge cap, offering a 40% discount for early payment within 14 days. It also seeks to modify debt recovery fees, which are currently capped at £70 by the industry.\n\nMinister for Building Safety, Fire and Local Growth, Alex Norris stated: \"For the 35 million people in Britain who rely on cars as their main means of transport, the ability to park with peace of mind isn\'t just about convenience. It is vital for their quality of life.\"\n\n\"That\'s why our Code will tackle misleading tactics and confusing processes, bringing vital oversight and transparency to raise standards across the board. This is another example of how we are fixing the things that really impact people\'s day-to-day lives, as part of the Plan for Change.\"\n\nHe remarked: \"Reports of poor behaviour by parking operators that make it difficult for motorists to comply with the terms and conditions of parking and leave them open to parking charges and escalating costs.\"\n\nFurther commenting, he said: \"This Government wants to make swift progress to support and protect motorists, without penalising those private operators who run their car parks well.\n\n\"The parking industry\'s two trade associations recently published a single industry Code of Practice. But more needs to be done to raise standards and to hold parking operators to account.\"', 'https://i2-prod.examinerlive.co.uk/news/uk-world-news/article32052093.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_EV-Charging-Point-mini-cooper-Electric-vehicle-charging-network-station-in-central-on-street-London-England-UK.jpg', 'https://www.examinerlive.co.uk/news/uk-world-news/uk-drivers-could-see-major-32052094', 'huddersfieldexaminer', 'James Rodger', NULL, '2025-07-13 15:12:44', '2025-07-13 15:24:35', '2025-07-13 15:24:35'),

We found out that he had cheated almost 25 plus women by creating fake matrimonial profiles and has defrauded these women to the tune of Rs 40 lakhs so far and he has been doing it for the last six years, Thangamani told ANI.\n\nWe recovered army uniforms from him. He also has in his custody fake name plates in the names of Major Amit and Major Joseph. In addition to this, we also obtained a few fake ID cards from central police organisations, including the National Investigation Agency, the Territorial Army, and the Jammu & Kashmir Police, he further said.\n\nThe police also recovered printing papers that are used for creating these fake ID cards.\n\nWe also got hold of the printing materials, the papers that are used for creating these fake ID cards, and it also came to our notice that he had already married three women by posing himself as an army officer.

After marriage, I and the plaintiff lived together. To date, I have taken about six lakh rupees from the plaintiff. The plaintiff is an officer in the bank. When she was not at home, I used to talk to other girls. To date, I am in contact with about twenty-five girls from different states: Telangana, Andhra Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh, Chhattisgarh, Uttar Pradesh, Delhi, Punjab, Uttarakhand and West Bengal. I am in contact with them and have taken money from them. I had searched the IDs of army officers on the internet and made them myself using a printer. Using them, I could easily trap girls in my love trap, he said.\n\nHe said that to impress the girls, he made army uniforms, medals, a fake name plate, fake ID cards of the Army, NIA, Jammu Kashmir Police, Territorial Army and also bought a fake pistol.\n\nSo that no one suspects that I am not in the army. I used to talk to different girls using different fake names and meet them. That is why I had made fake ID cards in different names.

They frequently won the turnover battle on their way to usual blowout wins. While the shot will need plenty of work, Barnhizer has shown he fits right in on that side of the ball.\n\nBarnhizer finished with six steals in the Thunder\'s 104-85 Summer League win over the Indiana Pacers. That\'s fresh off a seven-steal performance in the Thunder\'s 90-81 Summer League win over the Brooklyn Nets. He became the first player in Summer League history to have back-to-back games of six-plus steals.\n\nThat\'s how you win over Thunder fans easily. Shots will come and go. Can\'t really control that. But blitzing the ball-handler or reading the passing lanes are variables you can control. So is diving for loose balls. Defense isn\'t as simple as trying hard. That undersells defenders, as you need to be smart and strategic. Barnhizer is the best of both worlds, though. He\'s not afraid to scrap his elbows and is also savvy enough to dissect what the opposition is about to do.\n\nOf course, none of this is new. Ask Northwestern fans. They saw Barnhizer play four college seasons there and gradually saw his role grow from a freshman who seldom played to a senior starter who played through chipped teeth.\n\n\"It\'s funny because my family, we\'re so grateful to be here. Especially my brother. He\'s sent me a lot of funny tweets. Not tweets that I shouldn\'t be looking at, but like some funny ones,\" Barnhizer said. \"Like, \'Man, I\'ll run through a brick wall for that guy already and we\'ve had him for a week and a half.\' That stuff is cool to see and I\'m blessed to be here. I just want to keep trying to be that player they love to see and compete every day.\"\n\nAs the Thunder bring their same roster back for hopes of a repeat, don\'t expect much out of Barnhizer in his rookie season. That said, the two-way player could win over more minutes with his all-hustle style of defense. That\'s the side of the ball the 23-year-old will bank on to translate over to the NBA and hopefully carve out a role.', 'https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/yjXOCLFESYGPBp81rR3ujA--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyMDA7aD0xMDA4O2NmPXdlYnA-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/thunder_wire_usa_today_sports_articles_686/e71720067045891e3def2e235f66cc61', 'https://sports.yahoo.com/article/brooks-barnhizer-appreciative-social-media-200059887.html', 'Yahoo Sports', NULL, NULL, '2025-07-13 15:00:59', '2025-07-13 15:24:35', '2025-07-13 15:24:35'),

Case-in point an article written by Dan Favale of Bleacher Report. Favale penned several potential trades involving James and Milwaukee Bucks star Giannis Antetokounmpo.\n\nAccording to Favale, the framework of one trade with James happens to involve the Dallas Mavericks.\n\nMore news:Lakers Rumors: NBA Insider Provides Concerning Update on LeBron James\' Relationship With LA\n\nDallas Mavericks receive: LeBron James\n\nLos Angeles Lakers receive: Kyle Anderson, Daniel Gafford, Naji Marshall, Klay Thompson, P.J.

This return would eat into their 2027 cap-space plans, but Gafford is the only one with money on the books for that season and should be easily dumpable on his current contract.\"\n\nDallas on paper would be a juggernaut with James joining a core with Kyrie Irving, Anthony Davis, Dereck Lively, and Cooper Flagg. The Mavs might \'go for it\' and put themselves in immediate title contention.\n\nAs for the Lakers, having a Doncic-centric offense with him running the show fully could end up being the best thing for this team. Gafford would immensely improve the team\'s defense and athleticism up front. Getting back the 2029 first round pick given in the initial Doncic deal enables the team to spin that elsewhere as another asset, or potentially keep with the hopes of adding a young rotation player.\n\nMarshall gives the team some youth and agility on the wing, Thompson and Anderson are proven veterans, and Washington is at the worst a very good rotation player on a playoff team.\n\nWhile there\'s skepticism that James would actually be traded, it\'s fun to delve into these hypotheticals.\n\nMore news: Bronny James Gets Honest About His Spot With Lakers Next Season', 'https://images2.minutemediacdn.com/image/upload/c_crop,w_4107,h_2310,x_0,y_134/c_fill,w_1440,ar_16:9,f_auto,q_auto,g_auto/images/ImagnImages/mmsport/all_lakers/01k006jk1hmhykbv9vxz.jpg', 'https://www.si.com/nba/lakers/news/lakers-blockbuster-3-team-trade-proposal-reunites-lebron-james-and-anthony-davis', 'Sports Illustrated', NULL, NULL, '2025-07-13 15:19:03', '2025-07-13 15:24:35', '2025-07-13 15:24:35'),

Another issue was that Alcaraz\'s serving, while speedy, was spotty.\n\nYes, there were 15 aces, but there also were seven double-faults. His first-serve percentage was just 53%. He was broken a total of five times, at least once per set.\n\nOne particular problem was his second serve, because Sinner was hammering returns on those slower offerings.\n\nThat left Alcaraz on the defensive too often.\n\n\"Today was complicated, a little bit,\" Alcaraz said, crediting Sinner with being \"one of the best returners on tour, without a doubt.\"\n\n\"I mean, with the nerves and everything, it was difficult to serve better,\" Alcaraz said. \"I just have to improve that, absolutely.\"\n\nHe also acknowledged that if he had a dip in form, it was caused more by Sinner than any sort of fatigue.\n\n\"He was pushing me to the limit on every point. So mentally, sometimes, it\'s really tough to maintain the good focus or the good level during the whole match when you see the opponent just playing such a great tennis,\" Alcaraz said. \"At some points, I didn\'t know what I had to do in the match, because from the baseline, I was feeling he was better than me, and I couldn\'t do anything about it.\"\n\n___\n\nHoward Fendrich has been the AP\'s tennis writer since 2002.

They scored their one run on a Giancarlo Stanton solo home run in the second inning. Cubs starter Shota Imanaga was brilliant and Chicago\'s bullpen barely broke a sweat, a sobering end to the first half after the way the Yankees were swinging the bat to start the month of July.\n\nEven with another quiet day on offense, however, the Yankees were in a position to win until their bullpen stumbled once again.\n\nThe Yankees were tied 1-1 with Chicago when Yankees manager Aaron Boone summoned Hamilton with one out in the top of the sixth. Warren gave up a leadoff double in that frame to catcher Carson Kelly.\n\nTwo pitches into Hamilton\'s outing, with Kelly on third, shortstop Dansby Swanson blasted a hanging slider out to left for a go-ahead, two-run shot. One run was charged to Warren, who took the loss and heads into the break with a 4.63 ERA. The other, of course, went to Hamilton, who entered play with a 0.61 ERA in his last 12 games. That momentum is suddenly gone.\n\nOne inning later, Hill gave up a two-out double to right fielder Seiya Suzuki followed by an RBI infield single from center fielder Pete Crow-Armstrong. Yankees shortstop Anthony Volpe had a play on the grounder up the middle, but Crow-Armstrong beat the low throw to first and Suzuki never stopped running, scoring from second.\n\nSet-up man Luke Weaver and closer Devin Williams got seven outs and didn\'t allow any runs, but seeing them succeed isn\'t the story here.

Hill and Hamilton are the next-best options.\n\nBeyond Stanton\'s home run, his fourth of the year, catcher Austin Wells\' line drive single to lead off the bottom of the sixth was the Yankees\' only other hit.

The latter is the one that impacted the lodge and other structures. The park initially was managing it as a controlled burn but then shifted to suppression as it rapidly grew to 7.8 square miles (20 square kilometers) because of hot temperatures, low humidity and wind, fire officials said.\n\nNo injuries have been reported.\n\nMillions of people visit Grand Canyon National Park annually, with most going to the more popular South Rim. The North Rim is open seasonally. It was evacuated last Thursday because of wildfire.\n\nFirefighters at the North Rim and hikers in the inner canyon were evacuated over the weekend. The park said along with the fire risk, they could potentially be exposed to chlorine gas after the treatment plant burned. Chlorine gas is heavier than air and can lead to blurred vision, irritation or respiratory problems if high amounts of it are breathed in, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\n\nRafters on the Colorado River through the Grand Canyon also were told to bypass Phantom Ranch, which has a set of cabins and dormitories along the river.\n\nThe North Rim lodge was often the first prominent feature that visitors see, even before viewing the canyon. A highway ends at the lodge, which was known for its sloped roof, huge ponderosa beams and massive limestone facade. By walking across the lobby and descending a stairwell, visitors could get their first view of the Grand Canyon shining through windows across the \"Sun Room.\"\n\nMeanwhile, officials reported progress in battling a second wildfire burning north of the Grand Canyon. Fire lines on the White Sage Fire that forced evacuations at the North Rim and in the community of Jacob Lake were holding, officials said. On the southern edge of the fire, hand crews and bulldozers were working uphill, and the spread of the blaze had been minimal.\n\nBut to the east and north, the fire has spread rapidly, with grasses and standing dead trees contributing to the fire\'s intensity, officials said.

Together, these contributions offer a timeless and practical framework, and vital tools, for cultivating empathy, resilience, and a sense of universal responsibility in the 21st century, explained.\n\nProfessor Ceon Ramon, Affiliate Professor, Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Washington, US, speaking on Quantum Physics, Neurosciences and Buddhism, explained these concepts with examples with the aim to demonstrate the similarities and differences between scientific theories and Buddhist philosophy.\n\nAnother area of interaction is the combination of quantum and superluminal (faster than light) physics with Buddhist philosophy. He said that with this, one can explain the Buddhist concept of the luminous nature of the mind, which helps to describe the spontaneous transfer of information between two events that are separated in space.\n\nAssociate Professor Edi Ramawijaya Putra, Sriwijaya State Buddhist College of Tangerang Banten, Indonesia, said the Dalai Lama was concerned about the lack of individual responsibility toward social and global welfare. This deliberately violates the ultimate goal of education itself.\n\nTherefore, learners must accentuate themselves that their presence in this world is not merely about individual purpose, but also for the benfits of other being, he explained.\n\nEducational stakeholders, including policy-makers worldwide, must start reimagining the curricula that provide more on educating the heart not only education the mind. More importantly, designing outcomes that equips learners resilience as an equalizer of life through the voltailities, uncertainities, complexities and biases, Prof. Putra mentioned.\n\nKate Saunders, Co-Founder of Turquoise Roof research network and Tibet Watch, London, UK, said Tibetan Buddhism was standing at a critical crossroads, the future will determine not only the preservation of Tibet ancient spiritual traditions but also the continuity of its cultural identity under unprecedented Chinese control strategies.\n\nThis presentation examined how China systematic campaign to eliminate the Dalai Lama influence extended far beyond Tibet borders, employing what Beijing characterises as a protracted war to control religious succession while simultaneously promoting unyielding Marxist atheism.\n\nThe analysis was based on new research revealing the international dimensions of China reincarnation politics, demonstrating how Beijing multi-dimensional approach threatens traditional Tibetan governance structures that uniquely interweave religious and political authority based on the belief that leaders are enlightened beings who choose reincarnation to serve humanity.\n\nAt this pivotal moment of global instability, the preservation of Tibetan Buddhism represents more than cultural survival; it embodies a vital force offering practical guidance on compassionate education systems, ethical leadership, and sustainable resilience, providing alternative frameworks that humanity desperately needs to navigate an increasingly fractured world order where pluralism faces systematic assault from transnational authoritarian networks, she concluded.\n\nA special message to IBC by Dalai Lama was read out by Most Venerable Prof. Samdhong Rinpoche, the Guest of Honour at the event.\n\nAt the event, the Special Guest was Most Ven. Phrarat Vajarasuttiwong Dhammalongkornvibhusit Arayawangso, of Thailand, the Keynote Speaker was Dalai Lama, the 43rd Sakya Trizin Gyana Vajra Rinpoche of Dehradun, India, and the concluding remarks were by Most Ven. Nicholas Vreeland of the USA.\n\nIn a declaration at the end of a day-long conference in New Delhi on three pertinent subjects close to Dalai Lama heart: The Relevance of Buddha Dharma in the 21st Century, the Future of Tibetan Buddhism and the Preservation of its Culture, and Quantum Physics, Neurosciences and Buddhism, more than 500 participants, both nationals and from around the world unanimously supported the public statement.\n\nThe key message read that from the highlands of Tibet to the farthest corners of the world, the Dalai Lama teachings had transcended borders and beliefs. Inspiring millions to walk the path of non-violence, harmony, and inner awakening as the revered manifestation of Avalokiteshvara, the bodhisattva of compassion, the Dalai Lama has upheld and revitalised the precious traditions of Tibetan Buddhism, while also emerging as a global voice of conscience in contemporary times.\n\nIt further stated that the Dalai Lama has consistently championed the preservation of rich Tibetan culture and religious freedom, guiding his people with unwavering resolve. His recent statement announcing the continuation of his reincarnation, and only by Tibetan people without any foreign interference, is a testament to preserving its culture and heritage, as mentioned in the Declaration.

This article critically reappraises the role of glymphatic⁤ system dysfunction in Alzheimer\'s disease, synthesizing the latest scientific findings and⁢ expert insights to provide a complete overview.\n\nThe glymphatic system, first described in⁢ 2012, represents a revolutionary concept⁢ in neuroscience. It functions as the brain\'s primary pathway for clearing metabolic⁣ waste products, including ⁢amyloid-beta (Aβ) and ⁢tau proteins, which are hallmarks of Alzheimer\'s disease. This system operates primarily⁢ during sleep, utilizing ⁢cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) to flush out toxins from the brain parenchyma.\n\nThe glymphatic system\'s efficiency relies on the coordinated action⁢ of astrocytes and perivascular spaces. Astrocytes, a type⁤ of glial cell, play a pivotal role by regulating the flow of CSF⁢ into the⁤ brain along periarterial spaces. ⁢This CSF than percolates through the brain tissue, interacting with interstitial ⁣fluid and collecting waste ⁢products.⁤ The waste-laden fluid is subsequently channeled into perivenous spaces and⁤ ultimately drained via the lymphatic vessels ⁣of the meninges and the nasal cavity.\n\nCerebrospinal fluid (CSF): Acts as the primary ⁤flushing agent, carrying waste products away from brain tissue.\n\nAstrocytes: Gatekeepers of CSF⁤ entry ⁤into the brain, their aquaporin-4 (AQP4) water channels ⁢are crucial for glymphatic flow.\n\nPerivascular Spaces: The channels through⁢ which CSF and interstitial fluid exchange⁢ occurs, facilitating waste removal.\n\nSleep: A critical period for glymphatic system ⁢activity, with studies showing enhanced clearance during deep sleep.\n\nThe accumulation of amyloid-beta (Aβ) plaques and hyperphosphorylated tau tangles in⁣ the brain are the defining neuropathological features of Alzheimer\'s disease. Emerging evidence strongly suggests that ⁤a compromised glymphatic system is a significant contributor to this pathological cascade.\n\nWhen the ⁣glymphatic system falters, the brain\'s ability to⁢ clear Aβ peptides is⁣ significantly⁣ diminished. This leads to the buildup of Aβ in the interstitial space, promoting its aggregation into oligomers and eventually plaques. Research has demonstrated that impaired glymphatic function is directly correlated with increased Aβ deposition in preclinical models of AD.\n\nStudies using rodent models have provided⁣ compelling evidence for ⁤the glymphatic system\'s role in Aβ clearance. Genetic⁢ manipulation to impair glymphatic function,such as reducing AQP4 expression,results in accelerated ⁤Aβ accumulation. Conversely, enhancing glymphatic flow has shown promise in reducing Aβ ⁢burden.\n\nBeyond Aβ, the glymphatic system also appears to be involved in the clearance of tau protein. Abnormal tau phosphorylation leads to the formation of neurofibrillary tangles, another hallmark of AD. While the direct mechanisms are still being elucidated, impaired glymphatic drainage may hinder the removal of ⁢soluble tau species, ⁣contributing to their⁤ spread and aggregation.\n\nSeveral factors⁣ can compromise glymphatic function, many of⁢ which are associated with aging and AD risk factors:', 'https://feeds.science.org/rss/images/science/df53522850.jpg', 'https://www.newsdirectory3.com/glymphatic-dysfunction-alzheimers-disease-critical-appraisal/', 'News Directory 3', 'Dr. Jennifer Chen', NULL, '2025-07-13 15:12:17', '2025-07-13 15:24:36', '2025-07-13 15:24:36'),

According to a leaked presentation slide, Silicon Motion is set to officially unveil the MonTitan SM8466 SSD controller at the Flash Memory Summit next month, and the numbers are staggering. The new enterprise-focused controller is built to leverage the PCIe 6.0 x4 interface, with sequential read speeds of up to 28GB/s.\n\nThese figures, which first appeared in a leak from ITHome (via Guru3D), align with the expectations many had for the next-gen PCIe drives (twice as fast as flagship PCIe 5.0 controllers). The SM8466 controller is a powerhouse, featuring 16 NAND channels designed to support all upcoming forms of 3D NAND memory. This architecture will enable SSDs to scale up to a whopping 512TB on a single drive. To achieve this level of performance and density, SMI is reportedly turning to TSMC\'s N4 process node.\n\nDon\'t expect to slot one of these into your gaming rig anytime soon, however. The SM8466 is squarely aimed at data centre usage. It\'s expected to be compliant with the OCP NVMe SSD Spec 2.5 and NVMe 2.0+ specifications, making it ideal for cloud and hyperscale deployments. The feature set includes enterprise tools like SR-IOV for virtualisation, end-to-end data path protection, and robust security measures, including Secure Boot, TCG Opal compliance, and AES-256 encryption.\n\nThe performance of SM8466-based drives is set to blow past not only the best client SSDs but almost all current-gen enterprise storage solutions. The first SM8466-powered SSDs are still some ways off and may not arrive until early 2027.

Then, I thought about it more and decided to add to my original reply .\n\nI read Simplicius\' each week and I notice comments saying: Why does Russia just not finish the whole war quickly?\n\nGoing slowly is very smart to me, mainly because the Russians are not expending a huge amount of energy and they have enough supplies + they are still learning. On top of this the US is getting low on weapons which I am sure is part of Russia\'s objective.\n\nI have addressed this issue many times.\n\nEarly on in the SMO, I assumed -- like most people -- that the Russians would want to finish up quickly. I was right. And they did -- which led to Istanbul 1, which demonstrated clearly that the \"war\" was not with Ukraine or Zelensky -- but with the US and NATO.\n\nYup. Istanbul1 was a lemon. So, Putin did what he always does with lemons -- made lemonade.\n\nHe engaged then in a long war of attrition, not just of Ukrainian forces but of NATO capability. It progressed, and by the winter of 2022, I was wondering why Russia just didn\'t end the thing and get it over with. It could have, if it really wanted to.\n\nA Long War benefits Russian society in many ways -- and diminishes the power of the Western Collective-- the US and NATO at the same time. Just smashing the Ukraine, as (say) the US did with Iraq, would not solve the problem which is the historic animosity held by Western countries toward Russia. This hatred is something that Hitler understood -- which is why he irrationally thought that the West would congratulate him for invading Russia.\n\nPutin knew from Istanbul 1 that whatever happened with Ukraine, the war would continue, if only in another form, with other proxies.\n\nThe Long War keeps the West on the path of failure.\n\nBut a war of this kind unifies the always fractious Russian people: it has a kind of \"soft power\", strengthening Russian culture and waking them from the American \"dream\", which was always that -- a dream, wish-fulfillment stuff. It stimulates Russian patriotism.\n\nAt the same time, the war permitted Putin to institute a still-ongoing program of cautious reforms in all areas inside the country while promoting the concept of a multipolar world outside.\n\nThere are many paradoxes.\n\nZelensky was always Putin\'s best friend -- a strategic idiot. Then we had Biden-- another idiot who ultimately helped Russia grow.\n\nFinally, the biggest moron of all -- is our \"friend\", Trump, who is single-handedly destroying the US, leveraging the stupidity of his many useful European idiots. He will be lucky if, in the end, what is left of the US gets to join BRICS.\n\nPutin is so fortunate to have the West populated by delusional people, who allow Think Tanks such as the Project for a New American Century, which advocates for American hegemony, to do their thinking for them.\n\n\"Think Tanks\'? No \"Stink Tanks\".\n\nThe war is not over -- rather, it entering a new phase with Donbas almost liberated, as Larry Johnson writes in a recent article based on work by my friends at Southfront, for whom I also write.\n\nClick on image to access video (My voice)\n\nThe entire East bank of the Dniepr is now dominated by Russian forces with the UAF on the back foot.\n\nThe Ukrainians continue terrorist attacks on Russia -- which allows Russia to respond quid pro quo with massive strikes on military centers throughout Western Ukrainian, with local Ukrainians now supplying targeting information for the much hated recruitment centers -- a welcome sign of dissent!

Obviously, last year, we got to the Finals. But being there, being a part of winning basketball, has changed my entire perspective on this league.

Estimated auction price: $2 million to $4 million. Why so expensive? It\'s the largest piece of Mars ever found on Earth.\n\nSotheby\'s in New York will be auctioning what\'s known as NWA 16788 on Wednesday as part of a natural history-themed sale that also includes a juvenile Ceratosaurus dinosaur skeleton that\'s more than 6 feet (2 meters) tall and nearly 11 feet (3 meters) long.\n\nAccording to the auction house, the meteorite is believed to have been blown off the surface of Mars by a massive asteroid strike before traveling 140 million miles (225 million kilometers) to Earth, where it crashed into the Sahara. A meteorite hunter found it in Niger in November 2023, Sotheby\'s says.\n\nThe red, brown and gray hunk is about 70% larger than the next largest piece of Mars found on Earth and represents nearly 7% of all the Martian material currently on this planet, Sotheby\'s says. It measures nearly 15 inches by 11 inches by 6 inches (375 millimeters by 279 millimeters by 152 millimeters).\n\n\"This Martian meteorite is the largest piece of Mars we have ever found by a long shot,\" Cassandra Hatton, vice chairman for science and natural history at Sotheby\'s, said in an interview. \"So it\'s more than double the size of what we previously thought was the largest piece of Mars.\"\n\nIt is also a rare find. There are only 400 Martian meteorites out of the more than 77,000 officially recognized meteorites found on Earth, Sotheby\'s says.\n\nHatton said a small piece of the red planet remnant was removed and sent to a specialized lab that confirmed it is from Mars. It was compared with the distinct chemical composition of Martian meteorites discovered during the Viking space probe that landed on Mars in 1976, she said.\n\nThe examination found that it is an \"olivine-microgabbroic shergottite,\" a type of Martian rock formed from the slow cooling of Martian magma. It has a course-grained texture and contains the minerals pyroxene and olivine, Sotheby\'s says.\n\nIt also has a glassy surface, likely due to the high heat that burned it when it fell through Earth\'s atmosphere, Hatton said. \"So that was their first clue that this wasn\'t just some big rock on the ground,\" she said.\n\nThe meteorite previously was on exhibit at the Italian Space Agency in Rome. Sotheby\'s did not disclose the owner.\n\nIt\'s not clear exactly when the meteorite hit Earth, but testing shows it probably happened in recent years, Sotheby\'s said.\n\nThe juvenile Ceratosaurus nasicornis skeleton was found in 1996 near Laramie, Wyoming, at Bone Cabin Quarry, a gold mine for dinosaur bones. Specialists assembled nearly 140 fossil bones with some sculpted materials to recreate the skeleton and mounted it so it\'s ready to exhibit, Sotheby\'s says.\n\nThe skeleton is believed to be from the late Jurassic period, about 150 million years ago, Sotheby\'s says. It\'s auction estimate is $4 million to $6 million.\n\nCeratosaurus dinosaurs were bipeds with short arms that appear similar to the Tyrannosaurus rex, but smaller. Ceratosaurus dinosaurs could grow up to 25 feet (7.6 meters) long, while the Tyrannosaurs rex could be 40 feet (12 meters) long.\n\nThe skeleton was acquired last year by Fossilogic, a Utah-based fossil preparation and mounting company.\n\nWednesday\'s auction is part of Sotheby\'s Geek Week 2025 and features 122 items, including other meteorites, fossils and gem-quality minerals.', 'https://www.chicagotribune.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Geek_Week_Auction_08613-1.jpg?w=640', 'https://www.chicagotribune.com/2025/07/13/biggest-piece-mars-auction/', 'Chicago Tribune', 'Dave Collins', NULL, '2025-07-13 10:20:33', '2025-07-13 15:24:37', '2025-07-13 15:24:37'),

REUTERS/Daniel Cole\n\nA new \"Superman\" movie from Warner Bros hauled in an estimated $122 million to lead weekend box office charts in the United States and Canada, a strong domestic debut that kicked off a new era for DC comic book heroes on the big screen.\n\nThe movie that introduces David Corenswet as the Man of Steel added $95 million in international markets for global ticket sales expected to reach $217 million through Sunday, Warner Bros said.\n\n\"Superman\" is a reboot of the movie franchise based on the hero who debuted in comic books in 1938. The film\'s performance is critical to the future of Warner Bros and its DC Studios division.\n\nDespite a stable of iconic characters including Batman and Wonder Woman, DC has not been able to match the box office power of Walt Disney\'s DIS.N Marvel superhero films.\n\nThe new \"Superman\" was written and directed by James Gunn, the filmmaker known for three offbeat \"Guardians of the Galaxy\" movies for Marvel. Gunn was tapped as co-CEO of DC Studios in 2022, alongside producer Peter Safran, and billed as the hero who could bring consistent success to its film and TV projects.\n\n\"Superman\" is meant to set the stage for coming DC films including a \"Supergirl\" movie next summer and future Batman and Wonder Woman films.\n\n\"The DC vision is clear, the momentum is real, and I couldn\'t be more excited for what\'s ahead,\" Warner Bros Discovery Chief Executive David Zaslav said in a statement.\n\n\"Superman\" is one of only three films to debut with more than $100 million in domestic ticket sales in 2025 as moviegoing lingers below pre-pandemic levels.\n\n\"The domestic number is great. You can\'t beat a top three opening of the year,\" Jeff Bock, senior box office analyst at Exhibitor Relations Co, said of the \"Superman\" results.\n\nHe called the international ticket sales \"troubling\" for a big-budget action movie. The film cost $225 million to make, according to a source with knowledge of the budget.\n\nJeff Goldstein, president of global distribution at Warner Bros., said the studio was thrilled with the domestic response and that the movie about an American icon performed as expected overseas.\n\n\"We always knew that this would be bigger in the US than international,\" Goldstein said. \"Superman has always been very American-centric.\"\n\nGunn\'s take on the character earned positive reviews from critics. Eighty-two percent of reviews collected on the Rotten Tomatoes website gave the film a thumbs up.\n\nCorenswet stars opposite \"The Marvelous Mrs Maisel\" actor Rachel Brosnahan as journalist Lois Lane and Nicholas Hoult as villain Lex Luthor.\n\nAfter box office misfires last year including \"Furiosa\" and \"Joker: Folie à Deux,\" Warner Bros has notched six No. 1 openings in 2025.

Crowdfunding can get a startup over the hill.\n\nKevin Wolf, Wind Harvest cofounder and CEO, explained that developers of hardware face a double problem when it comes to financing: The banks won\'t finance until the technology has been certified, and that can\'t happen until the technology has been demonstrated, which requires money.\n\n\"It takes about two years to complete a \'technology readiness level,\' unless a company is well-funded,\" Wolf said. \"Six months to have all the components arrive, six months to install and fully test the prototype, and then another six months to complete the design.\" Meantime, a staff of engineers and the bills have to be paid.\n\nVenture capitalists have shown a decided disinclination to finance hardware, preferring computer-related software products, he said.\n\nBut with crowdfunding, operating through a special-purpose company, thousands of individuals have become venture capitalists. Thousands of them have hit it big.\n\nTwo standout companies grew into multibillion-dollar ones: Oculus VR and Peloton.\n\nOculus, the virtual reality technology company, used crowdfunding to raise $250,000 in 2012. Two years later, it was acquired by Facebook for $2 billion.\n\nPeloton, the fitness company, started with crowdfunding of $307,000, achieved a valuation of $8.1 billion in its initial public offering and rose to astronomically high valuations during the COVID pandemic. It has now fallen back considerably, after many difficulties in the fitness industry.\n\nWind Harvest is essentially offering new infrastructure that, should it catch on, would give it a steady and fairly predictable path.\n\nThe company\'s product, trademarked as Wind Harvester, is a vertical-axis wind turbine. The electricity generation and delivery component of the machine is on a shaft that is vertical to the ground. In the wind turbines, which are now familiar everywhere, the components are on a horizontal shaft.\n\nThe most famous vertical-axis wind turbine is the Darrieus, named after a French engineer who patented it in 1926. It has an elegant, eggbeater shape, almost like a fine outdoor sculpture. But it ran into problems with vibration and other technical drawbacks and has never been deployed at scale.\n\nAt the outset of the energy crisis in 1973, Sandia National Laboratory in New Mexico, one of the jewels in the crown of the national laboratory system, did considerable theoretical work on wind turbines, concentrating on vertical-axis designs. But when the research was moved to another laboratory, the horizontal-axis wind turbine became the focus.\n\nThe codes developed at Sandia are foundational to the Wind Harvest design. Wolf explained that the choice between horizontal- or vertical-axis turbines isn\'t an either-or choice, except in ocean siting, where the tall, horizontal turbines have the advantage.\n\nWind Harvest turbines are designed to capture the wind resource much closer to the ground. Ideally, they fit under the tall horizontal-axis turbines and take advantage of the disturbed air coming off those machines. Also, wind at the surface is an unused resource now.\n\nBetween 8 feet and 15 feet off the ground and installed in pairs, Wind Harvest turbines can double the output of electricity from a wind farm while still leaving enough clearance for agriculture, whether it\'s grazing animals or growing crops. So, add efficiency to the virtues of these turbines: better use of the wind resources and better use of the land.\n\nThanks to crowdfunding in two tranches, Wind Harvest is now ready to go to market with utility-scale installations.\n\nWolf listed these additional virtues for vertical-axis wind turbines:\n\n* They are made in America, except for the blades, which are forged in Germany.\n\n* They can be designed to withstand a Category 5 hurricane.\n\n* They don\'t use rare earths in the turbines. They use ferrite magnets, which are iron-based.\n\n* Wind Harvest installations have a design life of 75 years with maintenance and some refurbishment. Most turbines now in use must be replaced after about 25 years.\n\nThe first turbines to be put into service are on an isolated ridge on St. Croix, the largest of the U.S. Virgin Islands, located in the Caribbean Sea, where the entire output of the first group will be devoted to an oil refinery, replacing costly diesel generation.\n\nBig ideas now have funding sources besides \"Shark Tank,\" venture capital and the banks.\n\nLlewellyn King is the executive producer and host of \"White House Chronicle\" on PBS.

It\'s currently unclear if he\'ll return to direct the forthcoming live-action sequel.\n\nThe original animated sequel, Lilo & Stitch 2: Stitch Has a Glitch, was released in 2005 and was a direct to video release. It never hit theaters and arrived at a time when Disney\'s direct-to-video release method was still a popular release strategy. With the film not as widely regarded as the first film, it\'s unclear whether or not Disney will take inspiration from the title when developing the sequel to its live-action Lilo & Stitch.\n\nThe live-action Lilo & Stitch is currently playing in theaters everywhere. The original animated film is available to stream now on Disney+.', 'https://comicbook.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2025/06/Stitch-lounging-in-live-action-Lilo-and-Stitch.jpg?resize=2000,1125', 'https://comicbook.com/movies/news/disneys-lilo-and-stitch-box-office-milestone-billion/', 'Comicbook', 'Nicole Sobon', NULL, '2025-07-13 15:18:59', '2025-07-13 15:24:37', '2025-07-13 15:24:37'),

The only change in itinerary would be to take down Rory McIlroy at the Genesis Scottish Open before a sellout crowd expecting the Masters champion to claim his 30th title on the PGA Tour.\n\nGotterup handled it all with poise to go with his great strength.\n\nHe delivered all the right shots -- the short birdie putt on the par-3 12th to build a two-shot lead, the 10-foot birdie on the par-5 16th to restore a two-shot lead -- and closed with a 4-under 66 to hold off McIlroy and Marco Penge of England.\n\nThe victory sends him to Royal Portrush for his Open Championship debut, an extended trip to links golf that is starting to suit him.\n\nTime to cancel that flight.\n\n\"I might do it right now in front of you,\" Gotterup said, the trophy at his side that also sends him to the Masters next year for the first time.\n\nHe earned those perks. Gotterup, tied with McIlroy to start the final round, drove into a bunker and had to make a nervy 4-footer for bogey on the opening hole. That was a reminder nothing was going to come easily.\n\n\"I definitely was the villain out there today,\" he said. \"I felt like I was ready and prepared mentally today. And that\'s kind of what I\'ve been talking about over the last couple of weeks, that I\'ve kind of gotten into the mix a little bit and just faded away a little bit. And today, my goal was to hang in there tough and I felt like I did that really well.\"\n\nHe finished at 15-under 265 and moves into the top 50 in the world for the first time.\n\n\"Chris played a great round of golf. He was so solid,\" McIlroy said. \"Made the bogey on 15 but bounced back with a really nice birdie on 16. After he got a couple ahead, I just couldn\'t claw back.\"\n\nGotterup was one shot ahead of McIlroy when he hit his tee shot on the 196-yard 12th hole to 2 feet for birdie -- McIlroy missed from 4 feet -- to take command.\n\nHis lead was down to one over McIlroy and Penge, but McIlroy missed a 12-foot birdie at the par-5 16th and Gotterup hit a right-to-left putt from 10 feet in the heart of the cup for a two-shot lead with two to play.\n\nGotterup was so emotional when it was over he could barely speak, rubbing his eyes before saying, \"Everyone at home ... this is awesome. I\'m not going to be able to keep it together.\"\n\nGotterup, built more like fellow New Jersey athlete Mike Trout than a golfer, also won the opposite-field Myrtle Beach Classic last year. The Genesis Scottish Open had one of the strongest fields of the year, and the perks are far greater.\n\nThe first stop is The Open at Royal Portrush. Gotterup earned one of the three final spots through the International Qualifying Series, joined by Nicolai Hojgaard and Matti Schmid.\n\nHojgaard closed with a 64 to move up 11 spots into a tie for fourth to join his twin brother at Royal Portrush. Schmid shot 71 and tied for 17th, helped by Jake Knapp\'s late collapse.\n\nKnapp was tied for the lead through five holes, but he took double bogey on the par-3 ninth and the rest of the back nine didn\'t go much better. He closed with a 74, losing on a chance to win and to play next week at Royal Portrush.\n\nMcIlroy had said he was playing his best golf since going into the Masters, which he won in emotional fashion to complete the career Grand Slam . This was the first time he had seriously contended since that Masters victory, good timing with The Open in his native Northern Ireland starting on Thursday.\n\nBut he couldn\'t keep up with Gotterup, who looked shaky at the start when he drove into a bunker and had to make a 4-foot bogey putt. He was rock solid the rest of the way.\n\n\"I\'m really happy with where my game is -- the way I played over the weekend, the shots that I hit, how I controlled my ball flight,\" McIlroy said. \"It has been a great week. Missing the trophy, that\'s about it.\"\n\nMcIlroy battled to the end, especially on No. 11 when he had to pitch out left-handed and still managed to save par. When it was over, he said he was on his way to Royal Portrush, which McIlroy had not seen since the Friday of the 2019 Open when he missed the cut.\n\nFormer U.S. Open champion Matt Fitzpatrick had a 67 and tied for fourth with Hojgaard, picking up valuable FedExCup points in what has been a down year.\n\nScottie Scheffler, the world\'s No. 1 player coming off a two-week break, had a 67 and tied for eighth. It was his 10th consecutive tournament finishing eighth or better, a streak that began in the Houston Open.', 'https://nbcsports.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/cc03491/2147483647/strip/true/crop/3037x1708+0+168/resize/1440x810!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fnbc-sports-production-nbc-sports.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F76%2F3c%2Fca9ba438466da45b20770ed56050%2Fhttps-delivery-gettyimages.com%2Fdownloads%2F2224933764', 'https://www.nbcsports.com/golf/news/chris-gotterup-takes-down-rory-mcilroy-at-scottish-open-earns-spot-in-the-open', 'NBC Sports', NULL, NULL, '2025-07-13 15:20:06', '2025-07-13 15:24:37', '2025-07-13 15:24:37'),

If the kid was going to come to CBA, he was going to come to CBA,\" said Sewnig, who retired after 30 seasons last year. \"But then when you saw him on the course, he had a very natural swing. And he also had the right attitude, which was basically, let\'s have some fun today.\"\n\nThe first time I knew of him during his freshman season. He shot 71 at Charleston Spring, and CBA shot 5-under-par 283 as a team to set the still-standing Shore Conference Tournament record.\n\nOn Sunday, Gotterup introduced himself to the rest of the world, as the 25-year-old outplaying Rory McIlroy head-to-head to win the Scottish Open and earn a place in this week\'s field at the British Open at Royal Portrush in Northern Ireland.\n\nMore: U.S. Open 2025: Chris Gotterup, Ryan McCormick repping Monmouth County golf at iconic Oakmont\n\nIn an emotional greenside interview on CBS moments after his final putt hit the bottom of the cup, Gotterup said, \"I don\'t know if I am going to be able to get it out. Everyone at home, it\'s just awesome - I\'m not going to be able to keep it together.\"\n\nIt was all made possible by a final-round 66 for a two-shot victory at the Renaissance Club in North Berwick, Scotland, having entered the final round tied with McIlroy.\n\n\"It was spectacular. He did exactly what he had to do,\" Sewnig said. \"It was smart golf and it was fun to watch. So good to see.\"\n\nThe biggest win ever by a Jersey Shore golfer is a career-changing moment for Gotterup, a Big Ten Player of the Year at Rutgers and national POY during one season at Oklahoma. And his second professional victory - he picked up a PGA Tour win as a rookie last season - stamps him as one of the top young players in the world, while vaulting him into the thick of the upcoming FedEx Cup Playoffs.\n\nGotterup, who grew up caddying at Rumson Country Club, ended up winning a Shore Conference individual title and a pair of Monmouth County crowns with the Colts, while helping them win the NJSIAA Tournament of Champions team title in the final tournament of his career in 2017.\n\n\"I\'d be a lying if I said I knew Chris was going to make it big,\" Sewnig said. \"I\'ve watched a lot of really good golfers, but that next level is such a different game. I watch guys chasing the dream, spending years and years just hoping to make it. So to see him playing at this level is spectacular.\n\n\"I just hope he\'s not tired of taking my text messages All I ever say is how happy we are and how proud we are of him.\"\n\nGotterup turns 26 next Sunday, when he hopes to be playing in the final round of the British Open.

The company accuses the website of widespread copyright infringement. After obtaining an early discove', 'Adult entertainment conglomerate Aylo, the parent company of Pornhub, has filed a lawsuit against the as-yet-unidentified operators operators of PornXP. The company accuses the website of widespread copyright infringement. After obtaining an early discovery order to unveil the operators through various domain registrars, the case moves forward with site blocking as part of the requested remedies.\n\nAdult entertainment is big business on the internet and several of the largest brands in this niche are owned by the Aylo conglomerate.\n\nFormerly known as Mindgeek, Aylo is the driving force behind free \'tube\' sites such as Pornhub, YouPorn, and RedTube. It also owns many adult brands, including Brazzers and Reality Kings, that charge for subscriptions.\n\nOver the years, the company has built an impressive library of more than 40,000 registered copyright works. The company\'s enforcement arm Aylo Premium protects this content by various means. It has sent many millions of takedown requests and also targets pirate sites in court, hoping to shut these down.\n\nAylo previously went after Goodporn and Daftsex in U.S. courts, which largely ruled in favor of the adult entertainment company. However, permanently taking these sites offline has proven to be quite a challenge, at a time when additional problematic sites continue to appear on the company\'s radar.\n\nThe latest legal battle pits Aylo against PornXP, an adult website offering access to adult videos while operating from over a dozen domain names. These videos allegedly include content owned by Aylo and posted without permission.\n\nIn a complaint filed at a federal court in Washington, Aylo writes that 2,040 of its works are shared across 71,400 individual web pages. Since PornXP doesn\'t have a visible upload functionality, the site\'s \'anonymous\' operators stand accused of uploading them.\n\nWith its most popular domain receiving over 7 million monthly visitors, PornXP poses a significant threat. Aylo notes that roughly 18% of the site\'s visitors come from the U.S. while the site uses itselff U.S.-based advertisers and other services.\n\nTo an effort to end the alleged infringement, Aylo sent more than 680,000 DMCA-compliant takedown notices to the website\'s email address. Aylo says that none of these takedown requests were honored, and the copyright infringing content remained online.\n\n\"Defendants did not remove any content identified in the takedown notices or respond to any of Plaintiff\'s DMCA takedown notices,\" the complaint reads.\n\nIn addition to contacting the site directly, Aylo also sent over 2.1 million DMCA notices to Google, asking the company to remove these URLs from its search results. While Google responded, PornXP claims that the company took no notable action.\n\nDespite the detailed description of the site and its alleged wrongdoings, Aylo knows little about the people who operate the domains. The defendants are listed as \"John Does\" instead, with the site\'s domain names the only clear identifiers.\n\nTo unmask the operators, Aylo requested an ex parte motion for early discovery, targeted at domain registrars and several associated privacy services. These third-party services include Porkbun, NameSilo, Spaceship, GoDaddy, the Public Interest Registry, Privacy Protect, PrivacyGuardian.org, and Private by Design.\n\nLast week, District Court Judge Benjamin H. Settle granted this discovery request, allowing Aylo to subpoena these services asking for the personal details of the domain registrants, including names, emails, and IP-addresses.\n\n\"This includes but is not limited to names, addresses, login information, billing and transaction records, account information, server logs and IP addresses, email exchanges, and IP login information related to the accounts for the PornXP domain names,\" Judge Settle ruled last week.\n\nWhether the subpoenas will return any usable information has yet to be seen. Ultimately, however, Aylo hopes to win a judgment in its favor, including a substantial damages award compensating it for the alleged copyright infringement.\n\nEnforcing a potentially favorable order is not always straightforward, especially against operators who might be outside U.S. jurisdiction. Therefore, the complaint includes a request for a broad injunction that requests registrars to transfer the PornXP domain names over to Aylo\'s possession.\n\nIn an attempt to cover all bases, the injunction request also includes a broad blocking request that orders ISPs, hosting companies, search engines and other intermediaries to block the PornXP domains and IP-addresses in the United States.\n\nSpecifically, it wants these third-party intermediaries to:\n\n\"Block or attempt to block access by United States users of PornXP websites by blocking or attempting to block access to all domains, subdomains, URLs, and/or IP Addresses that has as its sole or predominant purpose to enable to facilitate access to PornXP domains\"\n\nAt the time of writing, the PornXP defendants have not yet been served and Aylo has until October to do so. For now, all PornXP domains remain operational. However, given the substantial effort that has already been expended on the case, Aylo is determined to do all it can to change the status quo.\n\n--\n\nA copy of the complaint filed by Aylo at the United States District Court for the Western District of Washington at Tacoma is available here (pdf).

Following the stellar success of The Super Mario Bros. Movie, this is no surprise.

After all, they hold some of the biggest IPs in gaming, while video game movie adaptations have proven quite lucrative.\n\nWhile we currently have no further information on this potential film, we can assume it\'ll be animated like The Mario Bros.

Movie had. It does not need to be serious whatsoever and can simply be a fun experience, which as we all know is a mortal sin in the eyes of film critics.\n\nDonkey Kong himself is the perfect character for a comedic movie protagonist.

He said the visitor center, the gas station, a waste water treatment plant, an administrative building and some employee housing were among the 50 to 80 structures lost.\n\nIN CASE YOU MISSED IT | Wildfires force evacuations at Grand Canyon and Black Canyon of the Gunnison parks\n\nTwo wildfires are burning at or near the North Rim, known as the White Sage Fire and the Dragon Bravo Fire. The latter is the one that impacted the lodge and other structures. The park initially was managing it as a controlled burn but then shifted to suppression as it rapidly grew to 7.8 square miles (20 square kilometers) because of hot temperatures, low humidity and wind, fire officials said.\n\nNo injuries have been reported.\n\nMillions of people visit Grand Canyon National Park annually, with most going to the more popular South Rim. The North Rim is open seasonally. It was evacuated last Thursday because of wildfire.\n\nFirefighters at the North Rim and hikers in the inner canyon were evacuated over the weekend. The park said along with the fire risk, they could potentially be exposed to chlorine gas after the treatment plant burned. Chlorine gas is heavier than air and can lead to blurred vision, irritation or respiratory problems if high amounts of it are breathed in, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\n\nRafters on the Colorado River through the Grand Canyon also were told to bypass Phantom Ranch, which has a set of cabins and dormitories along the river.\n\nThe North Rim lodge was often the first prominent feature that visitors see, even before viewing the canyon. A highway ends at the lodge, which was known for its sloped roof, huge ponderosa beams and massive limestone facade. By walking across the lobby and descending a stairwell, visitors could get their first view of the Grand Canyon shining through windows across the \"Sun Room.\"\n\nMeanwhile, officials reported progress in battling a second wildfire burning north of the Grand Canyon. Fire lines on the White Sage Fire that forced evacuations at the North Rim and in the community of Jacob Lake were holding, officials said. On the southern edge of the fire, hand crews and bulldozers were working uphill, and the spread of the blaze had been minimal.\n\nBut to the east and north, the fire has spread rapidly, with grasses and standing dead trees contributing to the fire\'s intensity, officials said. The fire was pushing downhill toward the Vermilion Cliffs area, and crews were assessing opportunities to create buffer zones that help slow or halt the fire\'s progress.', 'https://ewscripps.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/ca631d9/2147483647/strip/true/crop/1024x576+0+117/resize/1200x675!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fewscripps.brightspotcdn.com%2Fe3%2Fb1%2F8f75d3554a48bc9c083af145c76e%2Fap25192811484801.jpg', 'https://www.wptv.com/us-news/an-official-says-a-historic-grand-canyon-lodge-has-been-destroyed-by-wildfire', 'WPTV', NULL, NULL, '2025-07-13 15:11:17', '2025-07-13 15:24:38', '2025-07-13 15:24:38'),

Now, the company knows it needs to innovate to stay ahead of the game and ensure its global dominance.\n\nThe streaming giant has recently forged various key partnerships that will help with its expansion in the years ahead. There are also some indications that it could go beyond its traditional offerings of film and television, eventually becoming an all-in-one entertainment hub that can service everyone\'s leisure needs.\n\nThe first signs that Netflix will soon outgrow its original business model are in the addition of gaming options on the platform. It has already partnered with some major game companies including Ubisoft, with whom it has a deal to make exclusive games and television series. It has also acquired some game companies such as Night school Studio and Spry Fox.\n\nIn addition to the games already available to play, the Netflix gaming project now has more than 80 titles in development. Clearly, the company believes this is the next frontier in their expansion. Furthermore, while they\'ve not explicitly said this, it\'s possible they may also soon look into including iGaming content. This is because online casinos have seen concurrent increases in their userbases alongside streaming services in recent years, with a host of new games and casino bonuses, such as despot matches or free spins, being added to the top sites regularly.\n\nIf Netflix can tap into this still relatively young and booming sector, it could be highly lucrative. There are also various games at these sites that directly expand upon Netflix-owned franchises, meaning there\'s already a connection to be exploited. But this is all to emphasize the importance of variety in Netflix\'s offerings on a broader scale. The variety of games must mirror the variety of their video content if they\'re going to win over the masses, and casino games are only one suggestion for how they might continue to do this.\n\nExpansion Into Budding Regions\n\nNetflix has shown time and again that it\'s highly committed to offering global content, and this trend looks set to continue. It recently announced some huge investments, which will run for the next four years. For instance, it has injected $1 billion into film and TV projects in Mexico in an effort to deepen partnerships with local creators.\n\nThere are also greater plans for expansion in Africa. Netflix and Canal+ already have an agreement to bundle their content together in France and Poland, and this is now being extended into 24 Sub‑Saharan African countries. Africa is a fertile market with the internet now starting to spread rapidly throughout the continent, and Netflix is wise to tap into this.\n\nFocus on Live Content\n\nThe other massive upgrade to Netflix\'s service in recent times has been the addition of live content. The whole concept of the platform in the past was to give users the chance to watch TV and film at their own leisure and to give them control. But the popularity of live streaming has been impossible to ignore, and Netflix has got on board with it.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/embed/eyymxGQuv3o?si=c8-JcmyzinCggJQy\n\nThe biggest partnership so far has been Netflix\'s deal with WWE to become the home of all its wrestling offerings. However, there have also been some other huge moves, such as the Mike Tyson vs. Jake Paul fight. Netflix also has the rights for the Fifa Women\'s World Cup, highlighting how it\'s swiftly becoming the platform for must-see events.\n\nNetflix is once again proving why it\'s the streaming leader and is successfully staying ahead of its competition. There\'s a strong chance that it is transforming into something new, and becoming more of a one-stop-shop for all entertainment needs.', 'https://mb.cision.com/Public/21505/4206839/9d307405a922e82e_400x400ar.jpg', 'https://news.cision.com/igaming-news/r/netflix-expanding-partnerships-in-its-quest-for-dominance,c4206839', 'News Powered by Cision', NULL, 'dmoz/Games, dmoz/Games/Online, dmoz/Computers/Virtual Reality/Multi-User Systems, dmoz/Games/Video Games/Adventure, dmoz/Games/Board Games/Economy and Trading, news/Technology', '2025-07-14 06:54:13', '2025-07-14 06:55:16', '2025-07-14 06:55:16'),

And while the model flexes frontier-level performance on paper, the rollout is raising just as many eyebrows for its price tag as it is for its capabilities.\n\nOn Wednesday, Musk revealed Grok 4 and its premium sibling, Grok 4 Heavy, calling the latter a \"multi-agent\" system, essentially an AI study group where multiple agents solve a problem and compare answers. It\'s meant to mimic higher-order reasoning. But here\'s the kicker: if you want early access to this \"study group,\" it\'ll cost you a steep $300 per month under a new SuperGrok Heavy subscription.\n\nPerformance-wise, Grok 4 lands some solid punches. It scored 25.4% on Humanity\'s Last Exam without tools, ahead of Gemini 2.5 Pro and OpenAI\'s o3 model. Its Heavy variant scored 44.4% with tools, a major jump over Gemini\'s 26.9%. Grok also set a record on the ARC-AGI-2 benchmark with 15.9%-16.2%, nearly doubling Claude Opus 4.\n\nBut it\'s not all clean wins. Just days before launch, Grok\'s automated X account posted antisemitic content, forcing xAI to limit its activity and erase parts of its system prompt that encouraged \"politically incorrect\" answers. At the same time, Linda Yaccarino stepped down as X\'s CEO, leaving a messy leadership void.\n\nMusk avoided addressing the scandal during the livestream, focusing instead on Grok\'s academic prowess and future roadmap, including an AI coding model (August), a multimodal agent (September), and a video generation tool (October).\n\nStill, the steep $300 price could limit traction. Developers and startups may hesitate to adopt Grok when rival models, already integrated into major ecosystems, offer competitive performance at a tenth of the cost.

In response, central banks in both advanced and emerging economies have maintained a cautious approach to monetary policy.\n\nOil prices have shown volatility, mainly due to supply factors and expectations of weaker demand. Agricultural commodity prices have declined slightly, supported by seasonal factors. However, inflation risks remain, driven by geopolitical developments, trade disruptions, and climate-related shocks.\n\nDomestically, the CBE\'s nowcast for the second quarter (Q2) of 2025 indicates that economic activity is recovering, with annual growth expected to remain close to the 4.8% recorded in Q1 2025, compared to 2.4% in Q2 2024.\n\nThe output gap is narrowing and is expected to close by the end of the current fiscal year (FY) 2025/2026, with demand-side inflationary pressures remaining limited under the current monetary stance.\n\nFurthermore, the CBE expects annual headline inflation to remain near current levels during the rest of 2025 before declining in 2026, depending on the persistence of non-food inflation and the impact of fiscal measures, including changes in administered prices.\n\nGiven these factors, the MPC sees it as appropriate to keep rates at current levels while monitoring the potential effects of recent legislative changes such as value-added tax reforms.\n\nThe committee said it will continue to assess the pace and scale of future policy adjustments based on economic data and risk developments. It reaffirmed its commitment to its price stability target of 7% (± 2 percentage points), on average, in Q4 2026.\n\n© 2020-2023 Arab Finance For Information Technology. All Rights Reserved.

Photo: Clive Tompsett/imagebank.sweden.se (Download)\n\nBritish campers increasingly choose Sweden\n\nFrom January to May 2025, Sweden recorded a remarkable 120,189 camping guest nights** from the United Kingdom.

Interest in camping and cabin holidays in Sweden is particularly strong, with 14% of travellers in the UK expressing very high interest* in these types of breaks. Furthermore, over half of all British travellers interested in Sweden (*57%) cited outdoor activities as one of their top choices, an increase from 44% in 2021, showcasing a growing preference for embracing the outdoors comfortably. Online behaviour also supports this trend, with a 24% increase in Sweden-related travel and holiday searches from UK users compared to 2023, representing the second sharpest growth among all international markets (The Bloom Consulting *D2 Digital Demand © 2024 report).\n\nThe enduring appeal of Swedish camping also lies in its diverse offerings, welcoming atmosphere, and strong commitment to sustainability. Campers are increasingly opting for sites that provide a genuine sense of atmosphere and hospitality. A growing number of Swedish campsites are certified according to the Green Key sustainability standard, aligning with the rising priority for eco-conscious holidaymakers. Additionally, major providers like First Camp, operating approximately 50 locations, implement their own comprehensive environmental concepts.\n\nSwedish campsites offer a wide variety of accommodation options to cater to diverse preferences, including:\n\nThe hunt for cooler holidays\n\nThe appeal is clear: searches for \"cooler holidays\" have surged by 300% over the past year, and bookings to traditionally milder destinations like Scandinavia and the Baltics are up significantly. A substantial 42% of travellers now prefer destinations with cooler temperatures, with 54% planning to shift activities to later in the day to avoid heat, firmly positioning Sweden and the Nordic region as frontrunners for summer travel in 2025. This shift supports the robust expansion of outdoor holidays in Sweden.\n\nCrucially, Sweden has truly captured the hearts of British travellers, with an astounding 92% of visitors eager to return* after their initial trip.

JPMorgan Chase chief executive Jamie Dimon is spearheading a pivot for his institution, even as he voices fears about the boom in unregulated, private lending. Dimon, who is considered the most successful banker in generations, previously compared the practice to the subprime mortgage fad which sparked the 2008 global financial crisis and laid waste to millions of Americans\' livelihoods.\n\nBanks issued high-risk home loans to borrowers with poor credit histories, and when the initial low interest rates finally spiked, borrowers found themselves unable to pay their mortgages, triggering the collapse of the US housing market. Dimon cited the mistakes bankers made which led to \'everything\' blowing up and triggered tough banking regulations. \'Parts of direct lending are good, but not everyone does a great job. That\'s what causes problems with financial products,\' he told clients in Miami in February.\n\nDimon warned the private lending trend - now worth a whopping $700billion - is a similar craze and there \'could be hell to pay\' if the market ultimately falters. These loans are generally so risky that traditional banks would not approve, but highly indebted companies are seeking them out from privatized financial firms, The Wall Street Journal reported. They took hold in 2015, as private equity giants with money to spare from successful pension funds sought higher returns and began dabbling in corporate lending.\n\nSuddenly, businesses had the means to circumvent the big banks tough regulations, promised loans without the need to secure a credit rating and with more flexible terms. They could borrow more than banks would traditionally lend, and in exchange would have a higher interest rate, with payments tacked on to the back of the loan. According to the Federal Reserve\'s data from 2024, companies that went down the private loan route paid between two to three percent more than with traditional banks.\n\nDefaults have historically remained low, but economists fear this could change swiftly in a sustained recession or market downturn. As early as 2021, Dimon was warning shareholders that the entire scheme \' looked like a bubble\' and would need to be \'assiduously monitored .\' But he was also looking for the safest way to tap into the market.\n\nOn the same day Dimon raised the alarm with clients about the risks, JPMorgan released a statement confirming it was increasing its \'direct lending commitment to $50 billion.\' \'This strategic move is designed to extend the firm\'s direct lending capabilities and provide tailored private credit solutions to meet the evolving needs of clients,\' the firm said. Under the new plan, corporate clients have the option to either take on a traditional loan or a private lending option, which could grant them access to more cash but see them saddled with a higher interest rate.\n\n\'Since 2021, J.P. Morgan has successfully deployed over $10 billion across more than 100 private credit transactions, serving both corporate and sponsor clients,\' JPMorgan said in a February statement. \'This latest commitment underscores the bank\'s dedication to being a leader in both the broadly syndicated and private credit markets.\' JPMorgan holds onto private loans and collects interest until it matures. Dimon has considered the risk and sees a path forward for JPMorgan to profit even if a crisis destroys the market.\n\nDuring the global financial crisis, a handful of bankers who predicted the crash were able to hugely profit by by betting against the very mortgage investments they sold to clients, making money as those investments ultimately collapsed. The crash happened when millions of Americans began to default on risky home loans, causing the value of those investments to plummet and triggering panic across the global financial system. Glenn Schorr, a senior analyst for Evercore, said: \'As a bank, you can only watch private credit come from nowhere and get to a trillion dollar industry for so long. \'This is what its clients are asking for.\'', 'https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2025/07/14/05/100282027-0-image-a-23_1752468255859.jpg', 'https://www.dailymail.co.uk/galleries/article-14903667/JPMorgan-deepens-50B-stake-private-credit-amid-market-meltdown-fears.html', 'Daily Mail Online', NULL, 'dmoz/Society/Government/Finance, dmoz/Home/Personal Finance/Money Management, dmoz/Business/Financial Services/Investment Banks, dmoz/Business/Financial Services/Mortgages, dmoz/Business/Financial Services/Employment, news/Business', '2025-07-14 06:23:47', '2025-07-14 06:55:17', '2025-07-14 06:55:17');

According to the latest edition of Trade Watch Quarterly for Q3 FY25, exports remained stable despite global challenges, supported by strong regional demand and calls for value addition and strategic expansion.\n\nIndia\'s agricultural export sector continues to show resilience in the face of global headwinds, with Q3 FY25 witnessing steady growth, driven largely by a surge in cereal exports, particularly rice. According to the latest Trade Watch report released by the Department of Commerce and NITI Aayog, India\'s agricultural and allied exports recorded a 1.2% year-on-year increase, reaching $13.1 billion, up from $12.9 billion in the same quarter last year.\n\nThis modest uptick comes at a time when global food prices have softened and international demand for agricultural commodities has weakened. Despite these pressures, India has maintained a stable export performance, underscoring the sector\'s resilience and adaptability amid an uncertain global trade landscape.\n\nOne of the biggest contributors was the 75.2% growth in cereals exports, following the lifting of export restrictions on select rice categories in October 2024. This policy adjustment significantly boosted outbound shipments, meeting rising international demand and reinforcing India\'s position as a dependable supplier in global grain markets.\n\nWhile India\'s overall merchandise exports grew by 3% in Q3 FY25 to $108.7 billion, agriculture\'s contribution remained steady, even as global demand contracted. Non-petroleum exports rose by 12.5%, with agri-products playing a key role in this expansion.\n\nIndia\'s farm exports also gained from regional trade trends. Exports to ASEAN nations, particularly Singapore, saw a sharp rise from $0.6 billion to $2 billion, with food and agro commodities forming a major share. Similarly, exports to West Africa and South Asia grew by 26.5% and 16.6%, respectively, highlighting expanding regional demand for Indian agricultural products.\n\nDespite this momentum, India\'s global share in agricultural exports remains below 3%, highlighting significant untapped potential. Experts argue that scaling up will require a stronger push toward value-added products, crop diversification, and targeted market access strategies.\n\nDr. Arvind Virmani, Member of NITI Aayog, congratulated the team behind Trade Watch for delivering a data-rich, analytically sharp publication. He emphasized that India\'s evolving trade engagement reflects deeper economic advancement, driven by competitiveness, innovation, and strategic alignment with markets such as the United States.\n\nDr. Virmani noted that, in a time when global trade is being reshaped by geopolitical shifts, technological changes, and policy uncertainty, the edition serves as a valuable resource for policymakers, industry, and academia. He emphasized that it offers forward-looking recommendations to improve trade facilitation and strengthen India\'s participation in global markets.\n\nIndia\'s Q3 agricultural export performance tells a story of both achievement and opportunity. While cereals surged, other sectors held steady, signaling the need for further investment in climate-resilient crops, organic certification, and processed food exports to unlock higher-value segments.\n\nPolicymakers stress the importance of logistics upgrades, compliance support, and FTA-driven market access to ensure future competitiveness. As nations worldwide seek trusted sources of food and farm inputs, India stands poised to become a key player, provided it deepens its trade capabilities and agricultural transformation.', 'https://img-cdn.krishijagran.com/104909/niti-aayog-s-trade-watch.jpg', 'https://krishijagran.com/news/india-s-agri-exports-show-resilience-in-q3-fy25-amid-global-headwinds-cereals-lead-the-surge-niti-aayog-s-trade-watch/', 'krishijagran.com', NULL, 'dmoz/Society/Issues/Economic, dmoz/Business/Investing/Day Trading, dmoz/Business/Investing/Commodities and Futures, dmoz/Business/Agriculture and Forestry/Marketplaces, dmoz/Business/Consumer Goods and Services/Marketplaces, news/Business', '2025-07-14 06:53:55', '2025-07-14 06:55:17', '2025-07-14 06:55:17'),

This is popular among the rich and the youth-obsessed of Hollywood.\n\nHowever, many experts have debated if the use of NAD - which naturally depletes in the body as we age - actually has a significant result.

If its movement truly replicates that trend, a price target of $1.2 could be reached -- an increase of over 4,000% from its current position.\n\nHowever, there\'s one thing that sets PENGU apart from most other memecoins, including PEPE. Pudgy Penguins, the token\'s base, isn\'t just a digital project. They\'ve generated over $13 million in real-world revenue through physical toy sales at Walmart, Target, and other major retailers.\n\nThey also have a royalty-sharing model for NFT holders, a rarity in the meme token world. And that\'s not all -- a new game called Pudgy Party is scheduled for release this August, along with plans to develop a Layer-2 network to expand their ecosystem.\n\nMeanwhile, in the past week, PENGU also received a boost after being officially listed on the eToro platform. For some, this might just be news. But upon closer inspection, it\'s evidence that the project is gaining widespread acceptance, especially since eToro is known as a regulated platform with millions of active users. With PENGU\'s inclusion in the list of tradable tokens there, its exposure to the global market is clearly expanding.\n\nFurthermore, there are even more exciting developments on the regulatory front. A few days ago, the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) acknowledged Canary Capital\'s hybrid ETF application, which includes exposure to both the PENGU token and the Pudgy Penguins NFT.\n\nThis move is not only a good moment, but also a source of great hope -- it\'s rare for memecoins to reach this stage. Martinez even predicted that if the ETF is officially approved in August, a surge of over 200% could occur in the near future.\n\nSignals from the derivatives market also point to a similar trend. According to CoinGlass, open interest for PENGU as of July 14th reached $407 million -- a 26% increase compared to the previous week. Data from Binance also shows a dominance of long positions with a ratio of 1.5288.\n\nIt means many traders believe the price can still rise higher. But, as always, over-optimism sometimes comes with warning signs. The RSI is currently at 81, and memecoin history often shows that such high readings can be followed by short-term price corrections.\n\nBeyond the technical side, community momentum is also driving this rally.

As viewers enter this space, they will feel like they are inside the world of \"Alien: Earth.\"\n\nThe story unfolds on a version of Earth dominated by powerful corporations. Hybrid human-cyborg characters face terrifying threats after a ship crash causes chaos in the futuristic Prodigy City. Consequently, the setting creates a tense and immersive backdrop for the action-packed series.\n\nAlongside the show, Apple Vision Pro users will also enjoy digital extras. These include panoramic super-resolution set images, Spatial Photos, and a companion podcast. As a result, users can dive deeper into the world of \"Alien: Earth\" while exploring the unique features of their headset.\n\nDisney+ has remained a strong partner since the launch of Apple Vision Pro. In fact, it was one of the first third-party apps optimized for the device. Over time, Disney has steadily expanded its support, adding immersive environments for popular titles such as Marvel\'s \"What If?\"\n\nThis new collaboration reflects Disney\'s continued focus on immersive storytelling. By combining a beloved sci-fi franchise with cutting-edge hardware, Disney and Apple are reshaping how people experience content at home. Therefore, \"Alien: Earth\" isn\'t just a show -- it\'s a glimpse into the future of entertainment.', 'https://www.tuaw.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/alien.jpg', 'https://www.tuaw.com/2025/07/14/disney-launches-alien-earth-for-apple-vision-pro/', 'The Unofficial Apple Weblog (TUAW)', 'Paul Terpstra', 'dmoz/Computers/Software/Desktop Customization, dmoz/Computers/Graphics/Web, dmoz/Arts/Animation/Cartoons, dmoz/Arts/Animation/Production, dmoz/Arts/Animation/Web', '2025-07-14 06:19:34', '2025-07-14 06:55:17', '2025-07-14 06:55:17'),
(172, 'Top 10 DevOps Security Challenges and How to Fix Them', 'As businesses increasingly move to DevOps for faster and better software delivery, security often gets less attention than it deserves. In many cases, teams only realize where the gaps are after something goes wrong.\n\nAccording to a recent report by Synop', 'As businesses increasingly move to DevOps for faster and better software delivery, security often gets less attention than it deserves. In many cases, teams only realize where the gaps are after something goes wrong.\n\nAccording to a recent report by Synopsys, over 74% of codebases used in production environments contain security vulnerabilities. If better security practices had been implemented during development, these vulnerabilities could have been tackled easily.\n\nThis does not mean that DevOps is risky to use. It just means that security needs to be part of the process, not something added on later. Let\'s break down the top DevOps security challenges businesses face today and discuss simple and practical ways to solve each of them.\n\nHere\'s a detailed breakdown of the ten key security challenges businesses face with their DevOps environments, and practical solutions to solve each of them.\n\nOne of the major DevOps challenges is that teams often don\'t prioritize security from the start. Developers and operations teams focus on speed and delivery, but often don\'t have enough training or guidance on security risks.\n\nFinding passwords, API keys, or tokens stored directly in the code is common. Developers often do this because it is the easiest way to get their applications running, and they do this mostly when they are under pressure to deliver faster. But this shortcut has its own drawbacks. Once these secrets are stored in version control systems, they are easily exposed to anyone who has access to the codebase.\n\nCI/CD pipelines are a great way to help teams release software faster. But if they\'re not properly secured, they can become easy targets for attackers. The pipeline has access to your code, secrets, servers, and deployment tools. So if it gets compromised, an attacker could silently inject bad code into your software, and you may still not catch it until it causes real damage.\n\nOne of the major and frequently faced security issues in DevOps is cloud misconfiguration. Common mistakes like public S3 buckets, open ports, or giving way too many permissions to a user or service can easily cause a data leak.\n\nAttackers actively scan the internet for these kinds of weak spots, and once they find them, they don\'t need to hack their way in, as the doo is already wide open.\n\nMany teams still deal with security as the last thing to do, and often run security tests at the very end of the development lifecycle. But by that point, everyone\'s already focused on launching the product or moving on to the next task. So, if security issues show up late, they either take longer to fix or get pushed aside altogether.\n\nMost modern applications are dependent on open-source libraries and third-party packages. While these tools can help make your software development faster, they can also introduce risks, especially if they are outdated or not checked properly.\n\nSometimes companies say, \"Everyone is responsible for security.\" But when no one is officially in charge, important security tasks can be missed. People assume someone else is handling it, and things can easily get out of hand.\n\nWhen your team can\'t clearly see what\'s going on in development, testing, and production, it\'s hard to catch problems or react to security threats in time.\n\nSometimes employees have more access than they need, especially if rules are different across systems or not updated often. This can be risky if someone from the organization changes their job or leaves the company.\n\nIn a DevOps environment, security incidents can escalate quickly due to the speed at which continuous integration and continuous deployments happen. If there is no clear plan in place for what to do in case of such incidents, teams might panic, make mistakes, or waste time. Even small problems can get worse without a clear response.\n\nHow to Solve It:\n\nEvery team has to deal with DevOps security challenges, but the key is how quickly they address them. Whether it\'s unclear roles, poor visibility, or inconsistent access, these problems can grow into bigger issues if ignored. So, treating them as soon as possible works best.\n\nHowever, many a times these challenges get so overwhelming to handle that teams often feel stuck. The good news? You don\'t have to handle it all by yourself. A great next step is to hire DevOps engineers who can bring the right tools and experience to your team, helping you build a safer, more reliable system.', 'https://www.webpronews.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/devops-challenges.png', 'https://www.webpronews.com/devops-security-challenges/', 'WebProNews', 'Brian Wallace', 'dmoz/Computers/Internet/Abuse, dmoz/Computers/Security/Authentication, dmoz/Computers/Security/Honeypots and Honeynets, dmoz/Computers/Programming/Threads, dmoz/Computers/Hacking/Exploits, news/Technology', '2025-07-14 06:48:29', '2025-07-14 06:55:17', '2025-07-14 06:55:17'),

Nah. That\'s been passed up by Gulf Shores, Destin, and countless Florida vacations spots over the years.\n\nMississippi\'s gleaming white coastline stretching from the outskirts of Louisiana to the \'Bama state line is no longer kept under wraps for locals to enjoy -- road trippers from as far as Illinois are making the scenic drive through the tip-top of the Delta all the way down to the vibrant coast, teeming with hidden gems, up-and-coming resort towns, and the razzmatazz of Biloxi.\n\nAs hard as it may be to fathom, we at Travel Off Path have covered Mississippi extensively to the point we\'re wondering if we should crown this affordable, thriving state as America\'s trendiest destination.\n\nUnpacking Mississippi\'s seemingly overnight success is actually a pretty easy task. Thinking back to the dark days of the pandemic, everyone\'s sense of wanderlust grew tenfold and then went back to the same-o, same-o spots like Cancun, Miami, and even smaller, yet equally amazing beach getaways, such as Gulf Shores.\n\nGulf Shores is actually a perfect example as one of Alabama\'s few postcard paradises is going through a transformation, opening their airport to the public for the first time ever (and the latest results say it\'s a raging success!).\n\nThat leaves Mississippi, a state that\'s usually the butt of jokes, but has clearly surpassed the backroads redneck notoriety. From personal experience, if a Southern beach town should be the butt of jokes, it\'s Galveston -- literally.\n\nLast time I was there, I stepped on a dirty diaper on the beach and people shrugged as if that\'s the norm.\n\nOther than Florida\'s packed beach towns and Gulf Shores\' continued rise to fame, Mississippi is the Gulf\'s only true white-sand coast undiscovered by the masses.\n\nAs quoted by the Biloxi Sun Herald, one recent out-of-town Mississippi beachgoer said, \"We wanted to see something different\". Adding, \"It\'s laid back. It\'s not overrun like Myrtle Beach.\"\n\n...And that\'s just the coast. Affordability, welcoming locals, far less crowds all factor in to why almost unheard-of inland cities like Vicksburg and Hattiesburg draw millions of annual visitors too.\n\nIf there\'s one city with a claim to fame, it\'s Biloxi. This vibrant coastal city boasts flashy casinos, resorts, and colorful beachside loungers along miles-long stretches of white sand.\n\nWhile Biloxi is popular, it doesn\'t see the level of crowds of nearby Gulf Shores, especially since there\'s no airport here.\n\nTo reach the Mississippi Coast by air, your best bet is to fly into Gulfport (or New Orleans as Plan B. The state\'s second-largest city is a great option for some of the whitest sand in the region, but lacks the small-town charm of numerous coastal hideaways nearby.\n\nYou can\'t go wrong with crowd-free beaches in towns like Long Beach, Pascagoula, and Mississippi\'s newest resort town, Pass Christian.\n\nThe highly anticipated Pass Bungalows are anchoring what\'s expected to become Mississippi\'s beach hotspot, giving Biloxi a breather.\n\nThough if you do decide to give Mississippi\'s Coast a chance this summer, there\'s one that tops them all, but it\'s only open to the public by ferry until October.\n\nShip Island is undoubtedly the state\'s most postcard-worthy vacation spot, though there are no hotels in sight.\n\nBest served as a day trip from Gulfport, Ship Island gives Florida\'s top beaches a run for their money with vivid blue waters unlike much of the Gulf\'s brackish waters, despite the bright white sand.\n\nIf you\'ve stuck with me this far, you likely batted an eye at some Mississippi beach towns you may not have heard of before, most notably Pascagoula and Bay. St. Louis is more of a stuck-in-time getaway rather than a proper beach town.\n\nPascagoula, though, is ready to prove it\'s more than a name on a train route, boasting open white-sand shores and newfound acclaim as \'America\'s most affordable beach town for homebuyers in 2025\' according to Realtor.com -- and you know the everyday prices translate to tourists too.\n\nFor example, you can grab a Shrimp Sandwich at Brady\'s Steaks and Seafood, just outside the revitalized Flagship District, for just $11.\n\nDo you know how much that would cost me where I live in San Diego?

We can\'t get anything from the refinery. They have no tankers or drivers, which means there is no way that they can supply us.\"\n\nMr Dant remains locked into a five-year supply contract despite Prax\'s failure, preventing him from sourcing a new fuel partner.\n\nThis means he has to rely on more expensive short-term supplies, which he said have already cost him £50,000 in lost profits.\n\nBullwinkle\'s Garage, another nearby forecourt in Lincolnshire, is also facing similar problems. A spokesman for the business said they went five days without any petrol because of the collapse.\n\nBoth petrol station businesses said they were blindsided by the company\'s failure, echoing complaints made by Ed Miliband, the Energy Secretary, earlier this month.\n\nAt the time, Whitehall officials said they were repeatedly assured that the refinery was not under immediate threat.\n\nHowever, Mr Dant questioned why ministers were not aware of the problems at Prax sooner.\n\nIt comes after The Telegraph revealed that the company had been battling cash flow problems for more than a year owing to a £250m tax liability with HMRC.\n\nIt is understood that Prax had approached the Government for support in 2024, although their request was denied.\n\nSigns of financial stress had also emerged at the company earlier this year when Prax started pulling direct debits from customers days earlier than planned.\n\n\"For us, how has it reached the point that the Government let them run an £250m unpaid tax, and it had not been probed before now?\" said Mr Dant.\n\nMr Miliband has since ordered a full investigation into the circumstances behind Prax\'s collapse, including \"the conduct of the directors\".', 'https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/2isfpAZK6CMP8HUhIJNjgg--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyMDA7aD03NDk7Y2Y9d2VicA--/https://media.zenfs.com/en/the_telegraph_258/e593aaf86ef9158b43ae2c06cf00b763', 'https://finance.yahoo.com/news/petrol-stations-run-dry-oil-120000919.html?guccounter=1&guce_referrer=aHR0cHM6Ly9uZXdzLnlhaG9vLmNvbS9yc3M&guce_referrer_sig=AQAAAAa5z3gZQjQ3lGAAO_jo7YoKlVtH-UVqUN09lser5tvDFFOm_tj4F_JidKELvIZNUxkSvW-6tXIXyTw1dsL4EDihnj2N7L7aLXF9uEsYa6vb5-nScz4SSarnkVldR9HT-R6dBctgMzycaiI2HEh0HvJBwD6Ab27_R_hs7zf4soMZ', 'Yahoo!

However, as of now, that possibility remains just a rumour.\n\nCeballos still has a contract with Real Madrid until 2027, but with limited minutes and strong competition in midfield, a move could make sense for both the player and the club.\n\nReal Madrid may look to balance the squad and free up space, while Juventus could provide Ceballos with the chance to take on a bigger role in Italy.\n\nFor now, no official offers have been made, but the coming weeks could be decisive for his future.', 'https://photobooth-api.onefootball.com/api/screenshot/%2Fv2%2Fphotobooth%2Fcms%2Fen%2F41372843%3Fdate=2025-07-14', 'https://onefootball.com/en/news/juventus-ready-to-spend-12m-to-sign-real-madrid-midfielder-facing-uncertain-future-41372843', 'OneFootball', NULL, 'dmoz/Business/Real Estate/Education and Training, dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Mailing List Teams, news/Sports', '2025-07-14 05:50:00', '2025-07-14 06:55:18', '2025-07-14 06:55:18'),

China ended the first half of the year with a record trade surplus, with factories riding out the tariff roller-coaster that upended global commerce.\n\nTrump promised a \"major statement\" later on Monday that could see him outline measures to address the war in Ukraine, including potential updates to US sanctions policy. Ahead of that, the president told reporters in the US on Sunday that Washington would send Kyiv more weapons.\n\nMeanwhile, official Chinese trade data showed crude imports have risen so far this year. The country\'s purchases of Iranian barrels jumped in June, according to data from Vortexa.\n\n\"Chinese crude imports were very solid, so it seems there is a demand for barrels,\" said Giovanni Staunovo, an analyst at UBS AG in Zurich. \"Secondly, everyone is awaiting Trump\'s announcement on Russia.\"\n\nStill, concerns over impediments to global growth may be tempering gains. Trump threatened 30% tariffs on goods from the European Union and Mexico hurting appetite for risk and the outlook for energy demand.\n\nOil is still almost 5% lower this year as traders and investors balance geopolitical tensions in the Middle East, which stoked concern over supplies, with the US-led trade war threating to crimp global demand.

By putting the foreign competition at a disadvantage, the tariffs allow U.S. steelmakers to raise prices - and they have. U.S.-made steel was priced at $960 per metric ton as of June 23, more than double the world export price of $440 per ton, according to industry monitor SteelBenchmarker.\n\nIn fact, U.S. steel prices are so high that Pilot Precision Products has continued to buy the steel it needs from suppliers in Austria and France -- and pay Trump\'s tariff.\n\nTrump has also created considerable uncertainty by repeatedly tweaking and rescheduling his tariffs. Just before new import taxes were set to take effect on dozens of countries on July 9, for example, the president pushed the deadline back to Aug. 1 to allow more time for negotiation with U.S. trading partners.\n\nThe flipflops have left factories, suppliers and customers bewildered about where things stand.

You can check out at any time. More info\n\nBus drivers in Majorca, Menorca, and Ibiza are gearing up for a strike following a stalemate in negotiations with employers regarding wages and working conditions. Despite six months of discussions, there seems to be little headway.\n\nJuan Rodríguez, the president of the works council and a veteran bus driver of two decades, has confirmed that the industrial action is \'100%\'set to go ahead Frustrated by the lack of progress, he stressed: \"The employers are not budging. Our patience is running out.\"\n\nHe also mentioned that nearly a month has passed without any engagement from the Balearic Transport Federation.\n\nPlanned 24-hour walkouts, which are likely to wreak havoc on the busy Balearic holiday destinations, are timed for July 18, 21, and 23 -- as many school summer holidays kick off in the UK. Should an agreement remain elusive, the strike is prepared to become indefinite from July 25.\n\nThe official start of the school summer holidays in the UK in 2025 is fixed for Wednesday, July 23, with many British families expected to fly to Spain immediately to bask in the holiday sun, reports the Express.\n\nThe TIB transport network encompasses trains and the metro; however, this upcoming industrial action will solely impact bus services. Majorca operates three bus companies, while Menorca and Ibiza each have two.\n\nNotably, the EMT buses serving Palma are independent from this dispute.\n\nWorkers\' assemblies have tentatively agreed on the possibility of strike action, which could trigger a significant disruption to bus services, particularly as it\'s planned for the peak tourist season. If the strikes go ahead, buses will still run, but only at minimum service levels.\n\nThe timing is particularly sensitive, considering the potential impact this industrial action could have against the backdrop of the bustling tourist season -- expected to be more severe than the effects of a previously proposed strike in the hospitality sector which has since been withdrawn. Last year, nearly 6.5 million passengers utilised buses between January and April, according to Transportes de las Islas Baleares (TIB), marking a 42% increase from the same period in 2022, and that was before the influx of summer tourists.\n\nAs noted in the Majorca Daily Bulletin, Mr Rodríguez remains hopeful that upcoming mediation by the TAMIB arbitration tribunal, set to commence on Tuesday (July 15), might lead to some positive developments. Yet he says, \"management will have to change a lot for there to be progress\".\n\nMeanwhile, the union SATI, which is playing a key role in the talks, is pushing for a salary increase of 9.6% for the current year, with further rises planned for 2026 and 2027 pegged at half percentage points above the rate of inflation. So far, the employers\' offer is an 8.9% raise spread over four years.\n\nThe workers are also campaigning to unlock a long-due seniority supplement linked to years of service, untouched for 17 years. In terms of working conditions, they\'re calling for a shorter maximum working day, set breaks during shifts, better weekly rest periods, and provisions for earlier partial retirement.\n\nRodríguez emphasised the need for an immediate update of the collective bargaining agreement (CBA), which acts as a legally enforceable contract between employers and workers\' representatives setting out employment terms and has not seen significant change in 40 years.\n\nHe pointed to vague clauses within the CBA that result in varied interpretations by concessionaire operators. Regarding the pay proposal from employers, it lacks any component related to seniority and fails to address other parts of the contract, leading the union to label it as utterly \"insufficient.\"', 'https://i2-prod.nottinghampost.com/news/uk-world-news/article10343263.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_Buses-of-the-public-company-TIB-parked-in-Felanitx-Mallorca-island.jpg', 'https://www.derbytelegraph.co.uk/news/uk-world-news/bus-drivers-majorca-menorca-ibiza-10343266', 'Derby Telegraph', 'Maddy Baillie', 'dmoz/Society/Work, dmoz/Society/Issues/Business, dmoz/Home/Personal Finance/Philanthropy, dmoz/Society/Issues/Labor, dmoz/Society/Work/Workweek Reduction, news/Business', '2025-07-14 06:53:41', '2025-07-14 06:55:18', '2025-07-14 06:55:18'),

Saudi Arabia surged to the top of regional league tables, accounting for 66% of total issuances ($6.25 billion) in the first six months of 2025.\n\nThe 25% increase on the same period of 2024 was driven by Vision 2030 infrastructure spending.

Key transactions included debut issuances from National Central Cooling ($700 million) and Omniyat ($500 million).\n\nThe majority of Mena sustainable debt issuances during the period were Islamic instruments ($6.8 billion), with the 17% year-on-year increase reflecting the emergence of Saudi Arabia and the UAE as global Islamic finance centers.\n\nThe period was also notable for the significant growth in AT1 issuances, which accounted for $3.15 billion of sales, the highest level seen in the last five years. AT1 issuances are a key way for banks to comply with the Basel 3 framework ahead of the initial phase in dates of 2026.

And do you know what I love more than anything? City fans! Bro, they\'re the best, the best fans in the world!\"\n\n-\n\nThe moment has gone viral among City fans, many highlighting it as further proof of Jack Grealish\'s connection to the club and the community. Known for his expressive personality and grounded nature, Grealish has consistently endeared himself to supporters with his off-pitch honesty and on-pitch flair, even during spells when form has been inconsistent.\n\nFor many, it also served as a timely reminder that beyond the transfer talk and media noise, the player remains emotionally invested in the Manchester City project. Looking ahead, the coming weeks could prove decisive.\n\nCity\'s transfer business is beginning to take shape, and any potential outgoings may be influenced by squad depth, tactical evolution, and offers received from abroad. While there is no formal indication that Grealish is being pushed towards the exit door, the situation remains fluid -- especially given the premium nature of attacking talent in the current market.\n\nShould City retain the 29-year-old for another season, his role may evolve, particularly as Guardiola continues to rotate between dynamic wide options and more fluid, centralised roles. If Grealish stays fit and regains full sharpness, he still has every chance of being decisive.', 'https://photobooth-api.onefootball.com/api/screenshot/%2Fv2%2Fphotobooth%2Fcms%2Fen%2F41372822%3Fdate=2025-07-14', 'https://onefootball.com/en/news/jack-grealish-issues-emotional-message-to-manchester-city-fans-amid-exit-rumours-41372822', 'OneFootball', NULL, 'dmoz/Society/Relationships, dmoz/Home/Urban Living, dmoz/Sports/Korfball/Clubs, dmoz/Home/Apartment Living/Roommates, news/Sports', '2025-07-14 05:45:00', '2025-07-14 06:55:18', '2025-07-14 06:55:18'),

Those who fled to India have had the responsibility of preserving these traditions,\" said Dalai Lama. He recalled the chaos of 1959 that forced him to flee Tibet, and how the Government of India has extended \"immense support\" and \"tremendous assistance\" to Tibetan refugees, allowing the revival of monastic universities and rigorous scholarly debate on Buddhist philosophy.\n\n\"Unlike China, where religious freedom is severely restricted and political control undermines genuine spiritual teaching, India offers a free and flourishing environment for the study of Buddhism\'s deepest philosophical texts, including the Middle Way (Madhyamaka) and logic (Pramana) from the ancient Nalanda tradition. \"In China, the political situation is not stable, I feel it would be difficult to teach about Buddhism in a country where there is no freedom,\" said Dalai Lama.\n\nHe highlighted how Tibetan Buddhism\'s rich heritage of dialectical debate and scholarly rigour thrives in India\'s monastic centers, where students actively engage in philosophical discussions that cultivate insight and compassion. This open intellectual environment contrasts sharply with China\'s politicised, superficial promotion of Buddhism, often stripped of its transformative spiritual depth.\n\nFurthermore, Dalai Lama praised the Himalayan region\'s shared language, culture, and Buddhist lineage with Tibetans, stressing the critical role of Indian institutions in upholding and spreading the authentic Dharma for the benefit of all sentient beings.\n\nWith India\'s democratic freedoms, centuries-old Buddhist educational traditions, and ongoing support for Tibetan refugees and monastics, it is clear why India remains the unrivalled sanctuary and beacon for Buddhism\'s future.

He said the visitor center, the gas station, a waste water treatment plant, an administrative building and some employee housing were among the 50 to 80 structures lost. \"Numerous\" historic cabins in the area also were destroyed, the park said.\n\nTwo wildfires are burning at or near the North Rim, known as the White Sage Fire and the Dragon Bravo Fire. The latter is the one that impacted the lodge and other structures.\n\nStarted by lightning on July 4, the Dragon Bravo Fire was initially managed by authorities with a \"confine and contain\" strategy to clear fuel sources. They shifted to aggressive suppression a week later as it rapidly grew to 7.8 square miles because of hot temperatures, low humidity and strong wind gusts, fire officials said.\n\nNo injuries have been reported.\n\nRELATED STORY | How exposure to wildfire smoke can put your health at risk\n\nArizona Governor Katie Hobbs called on the federal government late Sunday to investigate the National Park Service\'s response to the wildfire.\n\n\"They must first take aggressive action to end the wildfire and prevent further damage,\" she said in a post on X. \"But Arizonans deserve answers for how this fire was allowed to decimate the Grand Canyon National Park.\"\n\nMillions of people visit the park annually, with most going to the more popular South Rim. The North Rim is open seasonally. It was evacuated last Thursday because of wildfire, and will remain closed for the rest of the season, the park said in a statement.\n\nFirefighters at the North Rim and hikers in the inner canyon were evacuated over the weekend. The park said along with the fire risk, they could potentially be exposed to chlorine gas after the treatment plant burned. Chlorine gas is heavier than air and can lead to blurred vision, irritation or respiratory problems if high amounts of it are breathed in, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\n\nRafters on the Colorado River through the Grand Canyon also were told to bypass Phantom Ranch, which has a set of cabins and dormitories along the river.\n\nHistoric lodge burned\n\nThe Grand Canyon Lodge was often the first prominent feature that visitors see, even before viewing the canyon. A highway ends at the lodge, which was known for its sloped roof, huge ponderosa beams and massive limestone facade. By walking across the lobby and descending a stairwell, visitors could get their first view of the Grand Canyon shining through windows across the \"Sun Room.\"\n\n\"It just feels like you\'re a pioneer when you walk through there (the lodge),\" said Tim Allen, a longtime resident of Flagstaff, Arizona, and yearly visitor to the Grand Canyon. \"It really felt like you were in a time gone by.\"\n\nAllen said the North Rim felt special and more personal because of its remoteness and reduced number of tourists. He often spent time there camping and doing rim-to-rim hikes, trekking all the way to the bottom of the canyon and back out.\n\n\"It\'s heartbreaking,\" he said of the destruction caused by the fire.\n\nCaren Carney was staying at the lodge with her husband, parents and 12-year-old son when a park ranger knocked on their door Thursday and told them to evacuate. Carney\'s parents first took her to the North Rim in the early 90s when she was 12, and the family decided to do the same with her son this year now that he was the same age. She was overjoyed to show her husband and son the serene beauty of the North Rim for the first time, and to bring her dad back to one of his favorite places in the world.\n\nFROM THE ARCHIVES | Yes, wildfires are actually becoming more intense and more common, study says\n\nCarney said she was heartbroken Sunday to hear that such a \"magical place\" had burned down. After evacuating, the family from Georgia relocated to the South Rim to continue their vacation and they could see the blaze from across the canyon.\n\n\"We told my son while visiting that this is now a family tradition and he should bring his children when they are 12,\" Carney said. I hope there will be something as magnificent for them to see in the future, and I\'m so glad we got to have one final look at it in the present before it was lost.\"\n\nAramark, the company that operated the lodge, said all employees and guests were safely evacuated.\n\n\"As stewards of some our country\'s most beloved national treasures, we are devastated by the loss,\" said spokesperson Debbie Albert.\n\nAn original lodge burned down from a kitchen fire in 1932, four years after construction was completed, according to the Grand Canyon Historical Society. The redesigned lodge using the original stonework opened in 1937.\n\nThomas Sulpizio, president of the historical society, said the lodge contained some valuable archives that he wasn\'t sure were saved.\n\nThe lobby also contained a famous 600-pound bronze statue of a donkey named \"Brighty the Burro.\"\n\nMeanwhile, officials reported progress in battling a second wildfire burning north of the Grand Canyon. Fire lines on the White Sage Fire that forced evacuations at the North Rim and in the community of Jacob Lake were holding, officials said. By Sunday afternoon the fire had charred 63 square miles of terrain.\n\nOn the southern edge of the fire, hand crews and bulldozers were working uphill, and the spread of the blaze had been minimal.\n\nBut to the east and north, the fire has spread rapidly, with grasses and standing dead trees contributing to the fire\'s intensity, officials said. The fire was pushing downhill toward the Vermilion Cliffs area, and crews were assessing opportunities to create buffer zones that help slow or halt the fire\'s progress.\n\nWildfire closes national park in Colorado\n\nElsewhere, one of several wildfires burning in Colorado that closed Black Canyon of the Gunnison National Park, about 260 miles southwest of Denver, has burned 5.6 square miles and forced the evacuation of homes near the park. The fire was started by lightning on Thursday on the south rim of the park, a dramatic, deep gorge carved by the Gunnison River.\n\nColorado Gov. Jared Polis issued a disaster declaration on Sunday because of it and other fires burning in western Colorado. His office said they were all started the same day by the same storm.\n\nAnother wildfire burning near the Colorado-Utah border near La Sal, Utah, also started Thursday and has burned around 14 square miles.', 'https://ewscripps.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/bc6b3b5/2147483647/strip/true/crop/1024x576+0+96/resize/1200x675!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fewscripps.brightspotcdn.com%2F62%2F74%2F5cd72503410193b8919ddd367817%2Fap25194825098695.jpg', 'https://www.abcactionnews.com/us-news/wildfire-destroys-a-historic-grand-canyon-lodge-and-other-structures', 'WFTS', NULL, 'dmoz/Recreation/Theme Parks, dmoz/Recreation/Theme Parks/Individual Parks, dmoz/Recreation/Outdoors/Camping, dmoz/Recreation/Theme Parks/Defunct, dmoz/Recreation/Theme Parks/Water Parks, news/Environment', '2025-07-14 06:45:24', '2025-07-14 06:55:18', '2025-07-14 06:55:18'),

Speaking at a Lahore press conference, CM Muhammad Azam Khan Gandapur declared the protest a \'do or die\' movement set to peak on August 5, signalling a confrontational approach. However, PTI Punjab Chief Organiser Aliya Hamza openly questioned the vague plans, demanding clarity on the movement\'s goals and logistics, reflecting a lack of cohesion and leadership within the party.\n\nThe disarray within PTI mirrors the party\'s history of political theatrics rather than effective governance or constructive opposition. Gandapur\'s boast that PTI will mobilise \'every corner of the country\' regardless of being in government or not appears more posturing than practical politics, Geo News noted.\n\nPunjab Information Minister Azma Bukhari sharply criticised Gandapur and the PTI leadership for their hypocrisy and failure to address real issues. She challenged Gandapur to prove his claims by returning to govern effectively, citing government achievements like scholarships for talented students and rapid hospital construction as proof of tangible progress rather than empty slogans.\n\nAzma condemned PTI\'s violent past and ongoing disruptive tactics, accusing them of silence over tragedies in Swat and Balochistan and highlighting the party\'s role in promoting instability. She strongly denounced the party\'s involvement in spreading deepfake campaigns targeting the Army Chief, branding these as acts by enemies of the state aimed at undermining Pakistan\'s security institutions.\n\nAs the PTI struggles with internal conflicts and incoherent strategies, its attempts to destabilise the government risk exacerbating Pakistan\'s political instability, Geo News concluded.

She and her family live in Ormara, a town in Gwadar district, along the coast of Pakistan\'s south-western Balochistan province. Her husband is a fisher and like many fishing households in the area they are in crisis due to the Iran-Israel conflict.\n\nThe war has led Pakistan to close its border with Iran, disrupting both the inflow of fuel and the export of fish. This double blow has crippled fishing communities already suffering from the impacts of climate change and overfishing.\n\nBalochistan boasts an approximately 770-kilometre coastline along the Arabian Sea which plays a significant role in the country\'s fisheries.\n\nAllaudin Kakkar, a senior official from the Balochistan Fisheries and Coastal Development Department, told Dialogue Earth that the province\'s fishers contribute around 340,000 tonnes of catch annually, with a market value of nearly Rs19.9 billion ($70.1 million). This includes high-value species such as tuna, Spanish mackerel, croaker, Indian oil sardine, and Indian mackerel. With over 16,000 registered and 6,000 smaller, unregistered boats operating in its waters, fishing provides livelihoods to tens of thousands of families in the province.\n\n\"Despite this valuable contribution, the sector remains poorly regulated, underfunded, and deeply exposed to external shocks,\" says Kakkar.\n\nSuch a shock arrived when tensions escalated between Iran and Israel during the 12-day war. Before the conflict, fishers relied heavily on Iranian petrol and diesel, which although imported illegally by smugglers, was both affordable and easily accessible. With the closure of the borders, which remains despite a ceasefire, this supply chain collapsed. Now, fuel is either unavailable or sold at Rs180-200 ($0.63-0.70) per litre instead of the Rs150 ($0.53) it cost before, notes Shams ul Haq Kalmati, chair of the Gwadar Chamber of Commerce.\n\nA local source told Dialogue Earth that daily imports of Iranian fuel into Balochistan have plummeted from 600,000 to 140,000 barrels. Other local sources say that before the border closed, more than 300 large oil depots, 1,000 pumps and 2,000 shops were almost exclusively selling Iranian fuel in the port city of Gwadar and surrounding areas, with only two pumps that sold Pakistani petrol.\n\nDespite these developments, Gwadar deputy commissioner Hamood Ur Rehman maintains that there is no major problem and the situation has normalised.\n\n\"This crisis is not only economic, it\'s ecological as well,\" warns Muhammad Moazzam Khan, technical adviser on marine issues at WWF-Pakistan.\n\nHe fears that the sudden halt in fishing due to the fuel-price increase, especially the catching of top predatory fish such as tuna, could disturb the balance of the marine ecosystem.\n\nThe current geopolitical tension is severely impacting Pakistan\'s coastal and pelagic fisheries, particularly tuna, says Khan. Every year, Pakistani fishers harvest approximately 50 to 60 tonnes of tuna and tuna-like species, most of which is sold directly to Iran. Although this export is illegal, like the fuel that moves in the opposite direction, the fish fetch high prices over the border.\n\nBalochistan tuna is generally not high enough quality for most international markets, says Khan, leaving Iran one of the few places willing to pay well for it. Iran offers prices ranging from Rs300 to 700 ($1.06-2.47) per kilogramme, and the total annual value of this export trade is estimated at around Rs15-35m ($52,900-123,300).\n\n\"Without access to the Iranian market, the entire tuna fishery is on the brink of collapse, threatening both income and employment for the affected communities,\" says Khan.\n\nTahir Rasheed agrees. He is the CEO of Balochistan Rural Support Programme, an NGO that supports rural poor and marginalised people in the province.\n\n\"Most of the tuna and other commercial [fish] are exported from Balochistan to Iran through barter trade, where fishers often exchange their catch, including tuna, for petrol and diesel,\" says Rasheed. The barter trade typically operates through Iranian speedboats that are registered in both Iran and Pakistan. They obtain fish from Pakistani fishers by journeying offshore to locations around the border of the two countries, as well as landing sites in Balochistan such as Gwader and Jiwani.\n\nIn addition to tuna sales, the swim bladders of some fish caught in the region are sought after as a delicacy in East and Southeast Asian markets. With fuel prices surging due to the border closure leading to higher land and sea transportation costs, thousands of kilogrammes of high-value fresh catch are going unsold. The domestic market is too weak to absorb the surplus, and cold-storage facilities are extremely limited, especially in remote coastal towns, notes Nakuda Dad Karim, a fisher from Gwadar. A lack of ways to preserve fish for exports -- such as canning or freezing -- means the crisis is rippling through the Balochistan economy.\n\n\"Without formal trade routes or preservation infrastructure, the entire supply chain is collapsing,\" says Kalmati. \"Ice factories, fish transporters, fish-processing owners, boat mechanics ... everyone is affected. This isn\'t just a fisheries crisis. It\'s a full-blown economic emergency.\"\n\nAll this has further depressed the price for fishers\' catches.\n\n\"I have been going to sea for over 40 years,\" says Karim. \"But I have never seen it this bad. We used to spend Rs15,000 ($53) on a trip and return with enough fish to make a small profit. Fuel cost alone has now exceeded Rs30,000 ($106) and we can\'t even sell our catch at a good price. Each trip feels like gambling our future.\"\n\nMany like Nakuda Dad Karim are now struggling to feed their families. His younger son, a crew member on the same boat as him, is considering moving to construction work, where prospects are better.\n\nJumait Jangir Baloch is a fisher and \"mole holder\" -- someone who is certified as a fish trader by the government -- in Gwadar.\n\n\"Some of us have stopped going to sea. It\'s not worth the loss,\" he says. \"We used to sell Spanish mackerel, barracuda, large croakers, and tuna to Iranian buyers. They paid us good rates in cash. Now, no one is buying, and even local traders offer half the price.\"\n\nWhile those who go to sea are mainly men, women are also affected by the crisis.\n\n\"Women here don\'t fish, but we grade, dry and sell them,\" explains Haleema Baloch from Gwadar, who does such work. \"With [business] down, we are losing our wages.\"\n\nFuel prices and the collapsing export market for catches have stopped many boats going to sea, depriving coastal communities of the cheaper fish they relied on for food and jobs.\n\nTalib Katchi from the Pakistan Fisherfolk Forum, an NGO advocating for fisher communities, tells Dialogue Earth that communities are losing sustenance as well as money. Women who work as independent fish retailers \"can no longer buy affordable species like sardines and Indian mackerel, cutting off food access for low-income communities\", he says.\n\n\"Women in fish processing are facing wage cuts, and small vendors can\'t find cheap fish to sell,\" adds Sami Gull, general secretary of the Fisherfolk Cooperative Society, Gwadar. \"The poor can\'t afford poultry or meat either. If this continues, it could trigger a serious food security and nutrition crisis.\"\n\nKalmati, of the Gwadar Chamber of Commerce, wants federal and provincial governments to intervene swiftly with fuel subsidies and reopen the border to properly regulated trade.\n\nProvincial official Kakkar acknowledges the severity of the crisis. \"We\'ve submitted a proposal for a Rs380m ($1.34m) endowment fund to support emergency fuel subsidies, welfare schemes, and compensation for affected fishermen,\" he says.\n\nRasheed, from the Balochistan Rural Support Programme, says that with cold-storage and canning facilities and other modern infrastructure, the province could transform its fishing industry into a lucrative export sector. This would reduce dependency on bartering and boost the economy. But \"we must act quickly\", he says.\n\nBalochistan\'s fishing industry, once a pillar of its coastal economy, teeters on the edge. Without swift and coordinated action, its collapse could reverberate far beyond its shores.\n\nThis article was originally published by Dialogue Earth and has been republished with permission.', 'https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/07/14163932c01db5b.jpg?r=164139', 'https://www.dawn.com/news/1924156', 'Dawn', NULL, 'dmoz/Recreation/Outdoors/Fishing, dmoz/Recreation/Pets/Fish and Aquaria, dmoz/Shopping/Pets/Fish, dmoz/Science/Agriculture/Fisheries, news/Business', '2025-07-14 06:52:18', '2025-07-14 06:55:19', '2025-07-14 06:55:19'),

Science has identified several possible culprits: ranging from undiagnosed long-COVID reducing mental faculties, lead in the brain from vaping, or our attention spans being destroyed by endlessly scrolling through social media.\n\nNow, the one man everyone looks to for societal diagnoses and mass-psychological insight has logged in. Yep, I\'m talking about Jake Paul, who took to X to opine that: \"Idicoracy the movie is happening in front of our eyes. So sad. People are so miserably dumb. So dumb and they don\'t even know it. How do we help them? Seriously asking...\":\n\nFirst up, \"Physician, heal thyself!\" Bemoaning people getting dumber while misspelling Idiocracy as \"Idicoracy\" is very much a \"throwing stones in glass houses\" kind of move. But, let\'s face it, we all mak typos from tim to tim, so we\'ll frogive!\n\nBut, beyond that, Jake Paul personally bears major responsibility for the dumbification of modern society. The most-liked reply, from someone who professes to be a Jake Paul fan, accuses him of being a \"full-on player\" in this process:\n\n\"You built a media empire on viral stunts, flex culture, and chaos. That is idiocracy fuel. You didn\'t just participate you helped accelerate the algorithmic decay. You\'ve monetized the exact short attention span dopamine trap you\'re now lamenting. Your entire career was forged in the fire of TikTok brain, and now you\'re shocked that people can\'t think long-term?\"\n\nPaul then tries his best to play down his role in this, replying: \"In the grand scheme of things I was just such a minuscule player\". To be fair, Paul didn\'t design the algorithms that prioritize IQ-killing slop, only exploited and monetized them beyond most people\'s wildest dreams.\n\nPaul goes on to argue he simply became \"addicted to making money\" and that he \"wasn\'t wise enough to see my impact on a grand scale\". The replies are having none of it:\n\n\"You speak like someone who stumbled into this by accident but let\'s not pretend this was all incidental.

You can\'t benefit from the exposure when it\'s convenient and then claim to be \"just a guy\" when you see the machine *You* helped build.\"\n\nWell, Mike Tyson may have failed to knock out Jake Paul, but this random X user just scored a haymaker on him and sent him plunging to the canvas. But, though Paul may be a giant hypocrite, perhaps we should give him a sliver of the benefit of the doubt.\n\nSure, he may have done way more than most in turning ordinary people into hooting morons, but at least he seems to want to change.

The US president has grown increasingly exasperated with Russian President Vladimir Putin\'s intransigence in talks to end the war, which is currently in its fourth year.\n\nBut it wasn\'t immediately clear whether the statement is going to include a promise of any fresh military aid beyond potentially using the $3.8 billion left from the package approved under the previous administration of President Joe Biden. A new sanctions bill against Russia has also been making its way through Congress.\n\nTrump said the US \"is not paying anything\" for the potential supply of the new batteries, which he said will be financed by the European Union. Last week he said it would be NATO that will pay for \"those weapons, 100%.\" A single Patriot battery system could cost more than $1 billion with missiles an additional around $4 million each.\n\nThe US wants to make a lot more weapons available to Ukraine, but also wants other, non-US funding, according to a senior NATO official, who asked not to be identified in order to speak more freely. The North Atlantic Treaty Organization would play the role of a coordinator with individual member states making the purchases, the person said.\n\nNATO Secretary General Mark Rutte is going to meet with Trump on Monday during a two-day visit to Washington after they spoke by phone on Thursday. German Defense Minister Boris Pistorius is also due in the US capital.

Gen. Keith Kellogg, was in Kyiv on Monday, a senior Ukrainian official said, as anticipation grew over a possible shift in the Trump administration\'s policy on the three-year war.\n\nTrump last week said he would make a \"major statement\" on Russia on Monday. Trump made quickly stopping the war one of his diplomatic priorities, and he has increasingly expressed frustration about Russian President Vladimir Putin\'s unbudging stance on U.S-led peace efforts.\n\nTrump has long boasted of his friendly relationship with Putin, and after taking office in January repeatedly said that Russia was more willing than Ukraine to reach a peace deal. At the same time, Trump accused Zelenskyy of prolonging the war and called him a \"dictator without elections.\"\n\nBut Russia\'s relentless onslaught against civilian areas of Ukraine wore down Trump\'s patience. In April, Trump urged Putin to \"STOP!\" launching deadly barrages on Kyiv, and the following month said in a social media post that the Russian leader \" has gone absolutely CRAZY!\" as the bombardments continued.\n\n\"I am very disappointed with President Putin, I thought he was somebody that meant what he said,\" Trump said late Sunday. \"He\'ll talk so beautifully and then he\'ll bomb people at night. We don\'t like that.\"\n\nRussia has pounded Ukrainian cities, including the capital, Kyiv, with hundreds of drones and cruise and ballistic missiles that Ukraine\'s air defenses are struggling to counter. June brought the highest monthly civilian casualties of the past three years, with 232 people killed and 1,343 wounded, the U.N. human rights mission in Ukraine said. Russia launched 10 times more drones and missiles in June than in the same month last year, it said.\n\nAt the same time, Russia\'s bigger army is making a new effort to drive back Ukrainian defenders on parts of the 620-mile front line.\n\nTrump confirmed the U.S. is sending Ukraine more badly needed Patriot air defense missiles and that the European Union will pay the U.S. for the \"various pieces of very sophisticated\" weaponry.\n\nWhile the EU is not allowed under its treaties to buy weapons, EU member countries can and are, just as NATO member countries are buying and sending weapons.\n\nGermany has offered to finance two new Patriot systems and is awaiting official talks on the possibility of more, government spokesperson Stefan Kornelius said Monday in Berlin.\n\nGerman Defense Minister Boris Pistorius was traveling to Washington on Monday to meet with Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth.\n\nGermany has already given three of its own Patriot systems to Ukraine, and Pistorius was quoted as saying in an interview with the Financial Times that it now has only six.\n\nA top ally of Trump, Republican Sen. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, said Sunday that the conflict is nearing an inflection point as Trump shows growing interest in helping Ukraine fight back against Russia\'s full-scale invasion. It\'s a cause that Trump had previously dismissed as being a waste of U.S. taxpayer money.\n\n\"In the coming days, you\'ll see weapons flowing at a record level to help Ukraine defend themselves,\" Graham said on CBS\' \"Face the Nation.\" He added: \"One of the biggest miscalculations Putin has made is to play Trump. And you just watch, in the coming days and weeks, there\'s going to be a massive effort to get Putin to the table.\"\n\nKirill Dmitriev, Putin\'s envoy for international investment who took part in talks with U.S. officials in Saudi Arabia in February, dismissed what he said were efforts to drive a wedge between Moscow and Washington.\n\n\"Constructive dialogue between Russia and the United States is more effective than doomed-to-fail attempts at pressure,\" Dmitriev said in a post on Telegram. \"This dialogue will continue, despite titanic efforts to disrupt it by all possible means.\"\n\nNATO Secretary-General Mark Rutte was due in Washington on Monday and Tuesday. He planned to hold talks with Trump, Hegseth and Secretary of State Marco Rubio, as well as members of Congress.\n\nTalks during Kellogg\'s visit to Kyiv will cover \"defense, strengthening security, weapons, sanctions, protection of our people and enhancing cooperation between Ukraine and the United States,\" said the head of Ukraine\'s presidential office, Andrii Yermak.\n\n\"Russia does not want a cease fire.

The request triggers a 45-day clock under which the funds are frozen. If Congress fails to act within that period, then the spending stands. That clock expires Friday.\n\nThe House has already approved Trump\'s request on a mostly party line 214-212 vote. The Senate has little time to spare to beat the deadline for the president\'s signature. Another House vote will be needed if senators amend the legislation, adding more uncertainty to the outcome.\n\nHere\'s a closer look at this week\'s debate.\n\nTrump has asked lawmakers to rescind nearly $1.1 billion from the Corporation for Public Broadcasting, which represents the full amount it\'s due to receive during the next two budget years.\n\nThe White House says the public media system is politically biased and an unnecessary expense.\n\nThe corporation distributes more than two-thirds of the money to more than 1,500 locally operated public television and radio stations, with much of the remainder assigned to National Public Radio and the Public Broadcasting System to support national programming.\n\nThe potential fallout from the cuts for local pubic media stations has generated concerns on both sides of the political aisle.\n\nSen. Mike Rounds, R-S.D., said he\'s worried about how the rescissions will hit radio stations that broadcast to Native Americans in his state. He said the vast majority of their funding comes from the federal government.\n\n\"They\'re not political in nature,\" Rounds said of the stations. \"It\'s the only way of really communicating in the very rural areas of our state, and a lot of other states as well.\"\n\nSen. Lisa Murkowski, R-Ala., said that for the tribal radio stations in her state, \"almost to a number, they\'re saying that they will go under if public broadcasting funds are no longer available to them.\"\n\nTo justify the spending cuts, the Trump administration and Republican lawmakers have cited certain activities they disagree with to portray a wide range of a program\'s funding as wasteful.\n\nIn recent testimony, Office of Management and Budget Director Russ Vought criticized programming aimed at fostering diversity, equity, and inclusion. He said NPR aired a 2022 program entitled \"What \'Queer Ducks\' can teach teenagers about sexuality in the animal kingdom.\" He also cited a special town hall that CNN held in 2020 with \"Sesame Street\" about combatting racism.\n\nAs part of the package, Trump has asked lawmakers to rescind about $8.3 billion in foreign aid programs that aim to fight famine and disease and promote global stability.\n\nAmong the targets:\n\n-- $900 million to combat HIV/AIDS, malaria and other diseases and strengthen detections systems to prevent wider epidemics.\n\n-- $800 million for a program that provides emergency shelter, water and sanitation and family reunification for those forced to flee their own country.\n\n-- $4.15 billion for two programs designed to boost the economies and democratic institutions in developing and strategically important countries.\n\n-- $496 million to provide humanitarian assistance such as food, water and health care for countries hit by natural disasters and conflicts.\n\nSome of the health cuts are aimed at a program known as PEPFAR, which President George W. Bush, a Republican, began to combat HIV/AIDS in developing countries. The program is credited with saving 26 million lives and has broad bipartisan support.\n\nOn PEPFAR, Vought told senators \"these cuts are surgical and specifically preserve life-saving assistance.\" But many lawmakers are wary, saying they\'ve seen no details about where specifically the administration will cut.\n\nThe administration also said some cuts, such as eliminating funding for UNICEF, would encourage international organizations to be more efficient and seek contributions from other nations, \"putting American taxpayers first.\"\n\nU.S. leaders have often argued that aiding other nations through \"soft power\" is not just the right thing to do but also the smart thing.\n\nSen. Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., told Vought there is \"plenty of absolute nonsense masquerading as American aid that shouldn\'t receive another bit of taxpayer funding,\" but he called the administration\'s attempt to root it out \"unnecessarily chaotic.\"\n\n\"In critical corners of the globe, instead of creating efficiencies, you\'ve created vacuums for adversaries like China to fill,\" McConnell told Vought.\n\nThe president has issued a warning on his social media site directly aimed at individual Senate Republicans who may be considering voting against the cuts.\n\nHe said it was important that all Republicans adhere to the bill and in particular defund the Corporation for Public Broadcasting.\n\n\"Any Republican that votes to allow this monstrosity to continue broadcasting will not have my support or Endorsement,\" he said.\n\nFor individual Republicans seeking reelection, the prospect of Trump working to defeat them is reason for pause and could be a sign the package is teetering.\n\nSen. Thom Tillis, R-N.C., opted to announce he would not seek reelection recently after the president called for a primary challenger to the senator when he voted not to advance Trump\'s massive tax and spending cut bill.\n\nSpending bills before the 100-member Senate almost always need some bipartisan buy-in to pass. That\'s because the bills need 60 votes to overcome a filibuster and advance. But this week\'s effort is different.\n\nCongress set up a process back when Republican Richard Nixon was president for speedily considering a request to claw back previously approved spending authority. Under those procedures, it takes only a simple Senate majority to advance the president\'s request to a final vote.\n\nIt\'s a rarely employed maneuver. In 1992, President George H.W. Bush, a Republican, had some success with his rescissions request, though the final bill included some cuts requested by the president and many that were not. Trump proposed 38 rescissions in 2018, but the package stalled in the Senate.\n\nIf senators vote to take up the bill, it sets up the potential for 10 hours of debate plus votes on scores of potentially thorny amendments in what is known as a vote-a-rama.\n\nDemocrats see the president\'s request as an effort to erode the Senate filibuster. They warn it\'s absurd to expect them to work with GOP lawmakers on bipartisan spending measures if Republicans turn around a few months later and use their majority to cut the parts they don\'t like.\n\nSenate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer offered a stern warning in a letter to colleagues: \"How Republicans answer this question on rescissions and other forthcoming issues will have grave implications for the Congress, the very role of the legislative branch, and, more importantly, our country,\" Schumer said.\n\nSenate Majority Leader John Thune, R-S.D., took note of the warning.\n\n\"I was disappointed to see the Democrat leader in his recent Dear Colleague letter implicitly threaten to shut down the government,\" Thune said.\n\nThe Trump administration is likening the first rescissions package to a test case and says more could be on the way if Congress goes along.', 'https://images.wral.com/asset/entertainment/2025/07/14/22085460/6874ebbac1fe9-media_3b8b799f1207491c91e6e33cdd60b5f6-DMID1-67muapesl-640x480.jpg', 'https://www.wral.com/story/a-senate-vote-this-week-will-test-the-popularity-of-doge-spending-cuts/22085459/', 'WRAL', NULL, 'dmoz/Society/Issues, dmoz/Society/Issues/Abortion, dmoz/Society/Activism/Media, dmoz/Society/Activism/Strategies, dmoz/Shopping/Niche/Politics, news/Politics', '2025-07-14 06:34:59', '2025-07-14 06:55:19', '2025-07-14 06:55:19'),

They provide streamlined services and help create a space for technological growth and innovation.\n\nEstablishing Technology Centers for Citizens\n\nThe Egyptian government is following a comprehensive national strategy to upgrade operational systems across all sectors and drive the country\'s digital transformation.\n\nCentral to this effort is the Digital Egypt Strategy, which is structured around three main pillars: fostering innovation, developing capabilities, and applying digital transformation.\n\nThe strategy focuses on international leadership, efficient infrastructure, as well as effective legislation and governance.\n\nIn line with this strategy, the Egyptian state is moving in a steady and accelerated pace towards implementing the digital transformation system. Over the past years, many relevant steps and measures have been taken to support this shift.\n\nThese measures aim to turn Egypt into a knowledge-based, innovation-driven society by relying on modern technological applications in obtaining services.\n\nAccordingly, the government is establishing technology centers for citizens and investors. The Ministry of Planning, Economic Development, and International Cooperation is implementing a project to develop and automate citizen services across 57 urban city authorities through technology centers.\n\nSo far, 34 city authorities have been developed. The ministry is also studying and analyzing workflow cycles to achieve optimal processes in preparation for digital transformation.\n\nEconomic Benefits and Streamlined Services\n\nSetting up technology centers across the country bears economic fruits for Egypt. Ehab Younis, Professor and Head of the Economics Department at El Shorouk Academy, tells Arab Finance that these centers will lead to numerous benefits. \"They will save time, effort, and expenses for both citizens and investors, due to the availability of electronic services and the speed of their delivery,\" he adds.\n\nAccording to Younis, these technology centers will further \"create job opportunities in technology and digital transformation, helping to lower unemployment rates. They will also attract investors, both local and foreign, by making their procedures easier and faster.\"\n\n\"These centers will also support entrepreneurship and innovation, while boost the efficiency of government services and closing the digital gap,\" he notes.\n\nEnhanced Service Delivery and Efficiency\n\nTechnology centers that have been developed in city authorities offer over 180 automated services to citizens. These services help save time, effort, and cost. The centers also provide various performance indicators that help monitor the completion rate of services, hold those who fall short in-service delivery accountable, and define employee responsibilities.\n\nAdditionally, it aims to enhance integrity and transparency by separating the service provider from the applicant. These centers also offer a suitable working environment for both the service provider and recipient, meeting government service quality standards.\n\nAnother key goal of the project is to automate and simplify service delivery procedures. This makes it easier for citizens and reduces waiting times. The project also integrates with participating entities such as security directorates, manpower authorities, the National Food Safety Authority, and others. Integration with other entities, such as civil aviation, is ongoing.\n\nThe creation of technology centers within local government agencies plays a vital role in the development of information systems. These centers enhance coordination and foster open communication and information sharing among different government institutions and agencies.\n\nAs a result, citizens can access the services they need through a unified system, without the need to visit multiple offices in person. This makes the process more convenient and efficient. These findings come from a study titled \'The Role of Citizen Service Technology Centers within Local Agencies in Community Development, within the Framework of Egypt\'s Vision 2030\', published by Al Azhar University in January 2025.\n\nFuture Prospects\n\nThe successful implementation and sustained impact of technology centers for citizens hinge on several critical considerations and a forward-looking vision. Paramount among these is ensuring equitable access and distribution.\n\nYounis explains, \"The centers has to be accessible to all citizens and investors. The state must ensure fair distribution of technology centers across different regions, provide services at nominal prices, and build partnerships with the private sector.\"\n\nLooking ahead, these technology centers are poised for significant evolution over the coming decade. Younis points out, \"Over the next decade, the role of these centers will evolve. They are likely to turn into research, development, and innovation centers, as well as incubators for emerging projects.\"\n\n\"Furthermore, education in artificial intelligence (AI) and big data must be supported, while continuing education and training must be promoted.\"\n\nEgypt\'s proactive embrace of digital transformation, spearheaded by the \"Digital Egypt Strategy\" and the establishment of technology centers for citizens and investors, marks a pivotal moment in the nation\'s development.\n\nThese centers are more than just service points. They are foundational elements in a broader national effort to modernize governance, stimulate economic growth, and empower its populace.\n\nBy Sarah Samir\n\n© 2020-2023 Arab Finance For Information Technology.

That geography also makes it one of the deadliest places in the U.S. for flash flooding.\n\nIn the early hours of July 4, 2025, a flash flood swept through an area of Hill Country dotted with summer camps and small towns about 70 miles northwest of San Antonio. More than 130 people died in the flooding. The majority of them were in Kerr County, including more than two dozen girls and counselors at one summer camp, Camp Mystic. Dozens more people were still unaccounted for a week later.\n\nThe flooding began with a heavy downpour, with more than 10 inches of rain in some areas, that sent water sheeting off the hillsides and into creeks. The creeks poured into the Guadalupe River.\n\nA river gauge at Hunt, Texas, near Camp Mystic, showed how quickly the river flooded: Around 3 a.m. on July 4, the Guadalupe River was rising about 1 foot every 5 minutes at the gauge, National Weather Service data shows. By 4:30 a.m., it had risen more than 20 feet. As the water moved downstream, it reached Kerrville, where the river rose even faster.\n\nFlood expert Hatim Sharif, a hydrologist and civil engineer at the University of Texas at San Antonio, explains what makes this part of the country, known as Flash Flood Alley, so dangerous.\n\nWhat makes Hill Country so prone to flooding?\n\nTexas as a whole leads the nation in flood deaths, and by a wide margin. A colleague and I analyzed data from 1959 to 2019 and found 1,069 people had died in flooding in Texas over those six decades. The next highest total was in Louisiana, with 693.\n\nMany of those flood deaths have been in Hill County. It\'s part of an area known as Flash Flood Alley, a crescent of land that curves from near Dallas down to San Antonio and then westward.\n\nThe hills are steep, and the water moves quickly when it floods. This is a semi-arid area with soils that don\'t soak up much water, so the water sheets off quickly and the shallow creeks can rise fast.\n\nWhen those creeks converge on a river, they can create a surge of water that wipes out homes and washes away cars and, unfortunately, anyone in its path.\n\nHill Country has seen some devastating flash floods. In 1987, heavy rain in western Kerr County quickly flooded the Guadalupe River, triggering a flash flood similar to the one in 2025. Ten teenagers being evacuated from a camp died in the rushing water.\n\nSan Antonio, at the eastern edge of Hill Country, was hit with a flash flood on June 12, 2025, that killed 13 people whose cars were swept away by high water from a fast-flooding creek near an interstate ramp in the early morning.\n\nWhy does the region get such strong downpours?\n\nOne reason Hill Country gets powerful downpours is the Balcones Escarpment.\n\nThe escarpment is a line of cliffs and steep hills created by a geologic fault. When warm air from the Gulf rushes up the escarpment, it condenses and can dump a lot of moisture. That water flows down the hills quickly, from many different directions, filling streams and rivers below.\n\nAs temperature rise, the warmer atmosphere can hold more moisture, increasing the downpour and flood risk.\n\nThe same effect can contribute to flash flooding in San Antonio, where the large amount of paved land and lack of updated drainage to control runoff adds to the risk.\n\nWhat can be done to improve flash flood safety?\n\nFirst, it\'s important for people to understand why flash flooding happens and just how fast the water can rise and flow. In many arid areas, dry or shallow creeks can quickly fill up with fast-moving water and become deadly. So people should be aware of the risks and pay attention to the weather.\n\nImproving flood forecasting, with more detailed models of the physics and water velocity at different locations, can also help.\n\nProbabilistic forecasting, for example, can provide a range of rainfall scenarios, enabling authorities to prepare for worst-case scenarios. A scientific framework linking rainfall forecasts to the local impacts, such as streamflow, flood depth and water velocity, could also help decision-makers implement timely evacuations or road closures.\n\nEducation is particularly essential for drivers. One to two feet of moving water can wash away a car. People may think their trucks and SUVs can go through anything, but fast-moving water can flip a truck and carry it away.\n\nOfficials can also do more to barricade roads when the flood risk is high to prevent people from driving into harm\'s way. We found that 58% of the flood deaths in Texas over the past six decades involved vehicles. The storm on June 12 in San Antonio was an example. It was early morning, and drivers had poor visibility. The cars were hit by fast-rising floodwater from an adjacent creek.', 'https://cbs6albany.com/resources/media2/16x9/1585/986/20x0/90/e1b451ed-2ddc-4cb5-9b3f-5290f7874787-Screenshot20250713133709.png', 'https://cbs6albany.com/news/nation-world/texas-flooding-disaster-what-went-wrong', 'WRGB', NULL, 'dmoz/Science/Environment/Water Resources, dmoz/Recreation/Boating/Paddling, dmoz/Science/Earth Sciences/Atmospheric Sciences', '2025-07-14 06:52:35', '2025-07-14 06:55:20', '2025-07-14 06:55:20'),

With backing from filmmaker Sir Peter Jackson, Colossal Biosciences hopes to resurrect New Zealand\'s extinct giant bird, the South Island giant moa.\n\nFrom Screen to Science\n\nThe Lord of the Rings director has invested $15 million in the project. Jackson, who owns hundreds of moa bones, says the mission brings him more joy than movies. \"The moa are my fun thing,\" he said, recalling a childhood fascination. His support is paired with the efforts of the Ngāi Tahu Research Centre in New Zealand.\n\nThe moa once stood nearly 12 feet tall. It disappeared 600 years ago, largely due to overhunting by humans. Its skeleton continues to intrigue researchers and museumgoers worldwide.\n\nResurrecting the Lost Bird\n\nColossal has previously worked on species like the dire wolf. This time, the challenge is different. Birds lay eggs, which makes the process less straightforward than mammalian IVF.\n\nThe team plans to start by extracting DNA from preserved moa bones. The genetic data will then be compared to modern birds like the tinamou and emu. \"We\'re looking for what made the moa unique,\" said chief scientist Beth Shapiro. The modified birds would then be raised in controlled habitats before any rewilding.\n\nNot Without Doubt\n\nSome scientists remain skeptical about the project\'s outcome. While traits may be replicated, reintroducing extinct creatures to modern ecosystems is complex. Experts caution that such ventures might shift focus from current conservation needs.\n\nStill, the vision remains strong. Colossal aims to see the moa walk again within five to ten years.

Republican President Donald Trump is building a wall of import taxes -- tariffs -- around the U.S. economy to protect domestic industry from foreign competition.\n\nYet American manufacturing has been stuck in a rut for nearly three years. And it remains to be seen whether the trend will reverse itself.\n\nThe U.S. Labor Department reports that American factories shed 7,000 jobs in June for the second month in a row. Manufacturing employment is on track to drop for the third straight year.\n\nThe Institute for Supply Management, an association of purchasing managers, reported that manufacturing activity in the United States shrank in June for the fourth straight month. In fact, U.S. factories have been in decline for 30 of the 32 months since October 2022, according to ISM.\n\n\"The past three years have been a real slog for manufacturing,\'\' said Eric Hagopian, CEO of Pilot Precision Products, a maker of industrial cutting tools in South Deerfield, Massachusetts. \"We didn\'t get destroyed like we did in the recession of 2008. But we\'ve been in this stagnant, sort of stationary environment.\'\'\n\nBig economic factors contributed to the slowdown: A surge in inflation, arising from the unexpectedly strong economic recovery from COVID-19, raised factory expenses and prompted the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates 11 times in 2022 and 2023. The higher borrowing costs added to the strain.\n\nGovernment policy was meant to help.\n\nBiden\'s tax incentives for semiconductor and clean energy production triggered a factory-building boom - investment in manufacturing facilities more than tripled from April 2021 through October 2024 - that seemed to herald a coming surge in factory production and hiring. Eventually anyway.\n\nBut the factory investment spree has faded as the incoming Trump administration launched trade wars and, working with Congress, ended Biden\'s subsidies for green energy. Now, predicts Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody\'s Analytics, \"manufacturing production will continue to flatline.\"\n\n\"If production is flat, that suggests manufacturing employment will continue to slide,\" Zandi said. \"Manufacturing is likely to suffer a recession in the coming year.\'\'\n\nMeanwhile, Trump is attempting to protect U.S. manufacturers -- and to coax factories to relocate and produce in America -- by imposing tariffs on goods made overseas. He slapped 50% taxes on steel and aluminum, 25% on autos and auto parts, 10% on many other imports.\n\nIn some ways, Trump\'s tariffs can give U.S. factories an edge. Chris Zuzick, vice president at Waukesha Metal Products, said the Sussex, Wisconsin-based manufacturer is facing stiff competition for a big contract in Texas. A foreign company offers much lower prices. But \"when you throw the tariff on, it gets us closer,\'\' Zuzick said. \"So that\'s definitely a situation where it\'s beneficial.\'\'\n\nBut American factories import and use foreign products, too - machinery, chemicals, raw materials like steel and aluminum. Taxing those inputs can drive up costs and make U.S producers less competitive in world markets.\n\nConsider steel. Trump\'s tariffs don\'t just make imported steel more expensive. By putting the foreign competition at a disadvantage, the tariffs allow U.S. steelmakers to raise prices - and they have. U.S.-made steel was priced at $960 per metric ton as of June 23, more than double the world export price of $440 per ton, according to industry monitor SteelBenchmarker.\n\nIn fact, U.S. steel prices are so high that Pilot Precision Products has continued to buy the steel it needs from suppliers in Austria and France -- and pay Trump\'s tariff.\n\nTrump has also created considerable uncertainty by repeatedly tweaking and rescheduling his tariffs. Just before new import taxes were set to take effect on dozens of countries on July 9, for example, the president pushed the deadline back to Aug. 1 to allow more time for negotiation with U.S. trading partners.\n\nThe flipflops have left factories, suppliers and customers bewildered about where things stand. Manufacturers voiced their complaints in the ISM survey: \"Customers do not want to make commitments in the wake of massive tariff uncertainty,\'\' a fabricated metal products company said.\n\n\"Tariffs continue to cause confusion and uncertainty for long-term procurement decisions,\'\' added a computer and electronics firm. \"The situation remains too volatile to firmly put such plans into place.\'\'\n\nSome may argue that things aren\'t necessarily bad for U.S. manufacturing; they\'ve just returned to normal after a pandemic-related bust and boom.\n\nFactories slashed nearly 1.4 million jobs in March and April 2020 when COVID-19 forced many businesses to shut down and Americans to stay home. Then a funny thing happened: American consumers, cooped up and flush with COVID relief checks from the government, went on a spending spree, snapping up manufactured goods like air fryers, patio furniture and exercise machines.\n\nSuddenly, factories were scrambling to keep up. They brought back the workers they laid off - and then some. Factories added 379,000 jobs in 2021 -- the most since 1994 -- and then tacked on another 357,000 in 2022.\n\nBut in 2023, factory hiring stopped growing and began backtracking as the economy returned to something closer to the pre-pandemic normal.\n\nIn the end, it was a wash. Factory payrolls last month came to 12.75 million, almost exactly where they stood in February 2020 (12.74 million) just before COVID slammed the economy.\n\n\"It\'s a long, strange trip to get back to where we started,\'\' said Jared Bernstein, chair of Biden\'s White House Council of Economic Advisers.\n\nZuzick at Waukesha Metal Products said that it will take time to see if Trump\'s tariffs succeed in bringing factories back to America.\n\n\"The fact is that manufacturing doesn\'t turn on a dime,\'\' he said. \"It takes time to switch gears.\'\'\n\nHagopian at Pilot Precision is hopeful that tax breaks in Trump\'s One Big Beautiful Bill will help American manufacturing regain momentum.\n\n\"There may be light at the end of the tunnel that may not be a locomotive bearing down,\'\' he said.\n\nFor now, manufacturers are likely to delay big decisions on investing or bringing on new workers until they see where Trump\'s tariffs settle and what impact they have on the economy, said Ned Hill, professor emeritus in economic development at Ohio State University.\n\n\"With all this uncertainty about what the rest of the year is going to look like,\'\' he said, \"there\'s a hesitancy to hire people just to lay them off in the near future.\'\'\n\n\"Everyone,\" said Zuzick at Waukesha Metal Products, \"is kind of just waiting for the new normal.\'\'', 'https://www.orlandosentinel.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Economy_Manufacturing_83970.jpg?w=640', 'https://www.orlandosentinel.com/2025/07/14/us-manufacturing-rut-trump-biden/', 'Orlando Sentinel', 'Associated Press', 'dmoz/Society/Issues/Business, dmoz/Business/International Business and Trade/Import and Export, news/Business', '2025-07-14 02:44:00', '2025-07-14 06:55:20', '2025-07-14 06:55:20'),

The BBC has informed Mr Wallace we have no plans to work with him in future.\n\n\"The investigation details a substantial number of allegations of inappropriate conduct spanning 19 years. This behaviour falls below the values of the BBC and the expectations we have for anyone who works with or for us.\n\n\"Although the full extent of these issues were not known at the relevant time, opportunities were missed to address this behaviour - both by the production companies running MasterChef and the BBC. We accept more could and should have been done sooner.\n\n\"We want to thank all those who took part in the investigation, including those who first raised concerns directly with the BBC in November last year. We apologise to everyone who has been impacted by Mr Wallace\'s behaviour.\n\n\"Lewis Silkin\'s findings include two further allegations which were upheld, relating to other individuals. The BBC takes these findings very seriously and we have asked Banijay UK to take action to address these issues, which is underway. This will be completed as a priority.\n\n\"The BBC will not be commenting further at this stage, but we are clear we expect the highest standards of respect at work to be upheld on the production.\"\n\nThe BBC has not made a \"final decision\" to air Gregg\'s last series, which was filmed in 2024.\n\nThe corporation\'s statement continued: \"At this stage we are not going to make a final decision on the broadcast of the series that was filmed last year. We know this is disappointing for fans of the show and those who took part and at the appropriate time Banijay UK will consult further with the amateur contestants.\n\n\"In April the BBC published a detailed response to an independent review of workplace culture, which reinforces expectations around behaviour and that we will act more decisively when standards are not met. This also requires all TV production partners to align with the Creative Industries Independent Standards Authority (CIISA) standards.\n\n\"We want to reaffirm, there is no place for the abuse of power, unacceptable behaviour or language at the BBC, or shows made for the BBC.\"\n\nGregg said he will \"not go quietly\" as he claimed the report found him \"primarily guilty of inappropriate language between 2005 and 2018\".\n\nIn a statement, published on Instagram, he wrote: \"I have taken the decision to speak out ahead of the publication of the Silkins report - a decision I do not take lightly.\n\n\"But after 21 years of loyal service to the BBC, I cannot sit in silence while my reputation is further damaged to protect others...\n\n\"I have now been cleared by the Silkins report of the most serious and sensational accusations made against me.\n\n\"The most damaging claims (including from public figures which have not been upheld) were found to be baseless after a full and forensic six-month investigation.\n\n\"To be clear, the Silkins Report exonerates me of all the serious allegations which made headlines last year and finds me primarily guilty of inappropriate language between 2005 and 2018.\n\n\"I will not go quietly. I will not be cancelled for convenience. I was tried by the media and hung out to dry well before the facts were established. The full story of this incredible injustice must be told and it is very much a matter of public interest...(sic)\"\n\nGregg apologised \"without reservation\" as he now recognised that \"some of [his] humour and language\" was at times \"inappropriate\".\n\nBut he added: \"But I was never the caricature now being sold for clicks.\n\n\"I was hired by the BBC and MasterChef as the cheeky greengrocer. A real person with warmth, character, rough edges, and all.\n\n\"For over two decades, that authenticity was part of the brand. Now, in a sanitised world, that same personality is seen as a problem.\"\n\nThe presenter recently revealed he had been diagnosed with autism and he has accused MasterChef bosses for failing to \"protect\" him from a \"dangerous environment\" amid his neurodiversity.\n\nHe wrote: \"My neurodiversity, now formally diagnosed as autism, was suspected and discussed by colleagues across countless seasons of MasterChef. Yet nothing was done to investigate my disability or protect me from what I now realise was a dangerous environment for over twenty years.

Such incidents not only grievously hurt the sentiments of Lord Jagannatha\'s devotees worldwide, but also cause deep anguish to the people of Odisha, for whom this festival holds profound emotional and cultural significance,\" Patnaik said in a post on X.\n\nUrging prompt action, he called on the Odisha Government and the Ministry of External Affairs to take up the matter with Canadian authorities.\n\n\"If these media reports are accurate, the Odisha Government should take the matter seriously and urge the Ministry of External Affairs to register a strong protest with the Canadian authorities,\" he added.\n\nThe remarks came in response to posts by Toronto-based Instagram user Sangna Bajaj, who alleged that eggs were thrown at devotees from a nearby building during the celebrations. \"People from a building throw eggs at us,\" she wrote in one post. In another, she stated, \"Someone from a nearby building threw eggs at us. Have you ever experienced discrimination for your faith?\"\n\nIn a troubling recurrence of targeted attacks on Hindu places of worship across Canada, the BAPS Swaminarayan Mandir in Edmonton fell victim once more to vandalism. The recent attack adds to a string of similar incidents documented in recent years, underscoring a distressing trend of religious intolerance. Last year, a Hindu temple in Windsor suffered defacement with anti-India graffiti, sparking widespread condemnation and calls for action from both Canadian and Indian officials.\n\nEarlier incidents in Mississauga and Brampton saw temples similarly targeted, drawing strong reactions from the Indian community in Canada. Canadian law enforcement agencies have been urged to take proactive measures to address these threats and ensure the safety and security of all religious communities in Canada.\n\nThe incidents have prompted renewed discussions on bolstering security measures around Hindu temples and enhancing efforts to combat extremist propaganda. Meanwhile, several global reports have highlighted the growing concerns over Khalistani sympathisers operating within Canada, with incidents often linked to calls for an independent Khalistan state in India\'s Punjab region.

It confirmed that the 2025 wheat procurement season is proceeding regularly, with operations continuing normally across various storage sites nationwide without any closures.\n\nIn this Factsheet, we explore the Egyptian wheat market\'s performance and how local wheat production supported Egypt in lowering its wheat import bill.\n\nThe wheat cultivation season in Egypt extends from mid-April to mid-August. During the ongoing season, the local farmers supplied the government with 91 million tons, a 16% year-on-year (YoY) increase. The increase in local supply was driven by the government\'s decision to raise the procurement price by 10% to EGP 2,200 per ardeb (equivalent to 150 kilograms). This price is even higher than the imported wheat price. Additionally, farmers\' dues are paid immediately within a maximum of 48 hours from delivery, which has encouraged farmers to grow wheat and supply it to the state in large quantities. Despite the increase in supply from local farmers, Egypt remains one of the world\'s top wheat importers. In 2024, Egypt imported wheat worth $4.4 billion, accounting for 7.8% of global imports. Egypt\'s largest wheat imports were mainly from Eastern European countries. Russia alone supplied Egypt with wheat worth $3.05 billion, representing 68.8% of the country\'s wheat imports. Ukraine and Romania followed with $595.1 million and $278.2 million, respectively. In season 2022-2023, Egypt\'s wheat production slightly declined by 5.8% from 9.6 million tons to 9.1 million tons. This drop was mainly due to the shrinkage in cultivated area by 7% YoY. The New Valley was the top wheat-producing governorate in 2022-2023, with 1.14 million tons or 12.5% of the country\'s total production. Sharkia and Dakahlia came next with production of 1.08 million tons and 773,864 tons, respectively. Egypt\'s wheat consumption hit around 16 million tons in 2024, leading to a self-sufficiency rate of 49%. Despite initially targeting a 65% self-sufficiency rate for 2025, the government adjusted this target to 51%. The government subsidized the local consumption of wheat flour and bread with EGP 124.3 billion, making up 77.7% of the total food subsidy budget for fiscal year (FY) 2025/2026.\n\n© 2020-2023 Arab Finance For Information Technology.

He\'s also the 2014 Open Championship winner, but he didn\'t fare well while facing enormous pressure at Royal Portrush in 2019.\n\nThe Northern Irishman missed the cut at the first Open Championship played in Northern Ireland in nearly 70 years despite being the betting and rooting favorite. He\'s also failed to crack the top five in each of the five solo events that he\'s played since winning at Augusta and missed the cut at last year\'s Open Championship.\n\nThe model has also locked in its projection for Scottie Scheffler, who is now a three-time major champion after winning the PGA Championship earlier this year. Scheffler didn\'t capture his first PGA Tour win until Feb. 2022 at the WM Phoenix Open, but he climbed to No. 1 in the world ranking later that season. Just 41 months later, he\'s now a 16-time PGA Tour winner and three-time major champion.\n\nHowever, Open Championship golf has been a test for the American. In four career starts in golf\'s oldest major, Scheffler hasn\'t finished better than T-7, and he finished outside the top 20 in two of those attempts. He\'s also cooled off a little since recording his third win of the season at the Memorial Tournament, finishing T-7 at the U.S. Open and T-6 at the Travelers Championship.\n\nMeanwhile, the model has examined Bryson DeChambeau\'s chances of winning a third major. The 31-year-old has piled up 14 worldwide wins, and he\'s helped modernize the game in more ways than one, with single-length clubs, an analytical style and an army of social media followers. He\'s also become one of the biggest major championship threats in golf, with six top-six finishes in majors the last three seasons and two major wins.\n\nHowever, he\'s coming off a missed cut at the U.S. Open, and he\'s also struggled to adapt to links golf. He\'s missed the cut in three of his seven career starts at Open Championships and has only recorded one top-25 finish, though it was a respectable T-8 in 2022. He\'s a different player since missing the cut at Royal Portrush in 2019, but will his playing style work in an Open Championship setting? See the full Open Championship projections from the model here.\n\nThe model is targeting five golfers with odds longer than 20-1 who will make a strong run at the Claret Jug. Anyone who backs these longshots could hit it big. You can only see the model\'s picks here.\n\nWho will win the 2025 Open Championship, which longshots will stun the golfing world, and where will Scottie Scheffler, Rory McIlroy and Bryson DeChambeau finish?

CEO Hyeokchan Kwon (23) founded it in December 2024. Kwon was a student at Yonsei University College of Pharmacy.\n\nKwon stated, \"I gained planning and execution skills through my activities as the president of the Yonsei University College of Pharmacy Student Council, the Yonsei University Student Council, and the Korean Pharmacy Students\' Association. I decided to start a business to create a platform that provides practical health solutions based on my pharmacy major.\"\n\nWellness Box is a pharmacy-based platform for customized, small-batch nutritional supplement delivery. Wellness Box utilizes AI analysis to interpret consumer health data and offer a service that safely delivers recommended nutritional supplements in small packages, following a pharmacist\'s review.\n\n\"Wellness Box uses AI to recommend appropriate nutritional ingredients based on users\' symptoms, medications, underlying conditions, and health examination data. A pharmacist reviews each order before dividing it into small packages for delivery. Customers can conveniently start by ordering a minimum of seven days\' worth of supplements. They can also monitor their health status and the effects of the supplements through the platform -- such as a website or app -- and receive continuous, personalized management. If the supplements are not suitable or effective, users can adjust their package based on feedback to find the right ones for them.\"\n\nWellness Box offers minimum unit delivery. The existing nutritional supplement market sells products in packages that last several months, making it difficult for consumers to determine their suitability. With Wellness Box, users can start with seven-day increments, which reduces the burden.\n\n\"By combining small quantities of multiple items, users can mix popular nutritional supplements from various manufacturers in a single pack. This feature allows for objective, performance-based combinations that are not dependent on specific brands. We have a pharmacy-based, pharmacist-reviewed system in place. After receiving AI-based recommendations, pharmacists at physical pharmacies conduct additional reviews and prepare small batches. They take into account the patient\'s medications and condition to ensure safety and professionalism.\"\n\nAnother strength is the expert-reviewed recommendation algorithm. \"These recommendations are highly scientifically reliable because clinical pharmacy professors and renowned counseling pharmacists advise them. We have signed MOUs with pharmaceutical delivery companies to ensure the safe delivery of susceptible products.\n\nWellness Box plans to leverage social media for influencer marketing with pharmacists.\" \"We will promote our products based on initial trust by collaborating with pharmacist influencers whose followers are interested in dietary supplements. Our customized marketing will target three main groups: exam takers, women, and seniors. Our promotions will focus on study cafes, fitness centers, and senior communities. Additionally, we will promote content tailored to each customer\'s needs, such as diet, anti-aging, and improved concentration.\"\n\nJ Ventures selected Wellness Box for its startup batch program, with plans to receive seed funding upon incorporation. Additionally, after passing the document screening for the startup batch program of BonAngels Venture Partners, Wellness Box completed interviews with examiners and partners and is awaiting a final investment decision. In the future, the company plans to attract government and private investment through programs such as TIPS.\n\nWhat made CEO Kwon decide to start a new company? \"While serving as president of the pharmacy student council, I saw many elderly people participating in volunteer activities for individuals in need who took multiple medications but knew little about nutritional supplements. Seeing the indiscriminate use of nutritional supplements that interact with medications firsthand was the catalyst for starting this business. We reduced costs by dividing the work among the co-founders. One co-founder was responsible for online development, eliminating outsourcing costs. We use my studio apartment as an office to minimize operating expenses. In the early stages, we lived together and worked on the business.\"\n\nRegarding his future plans, Kwon said, \"Although I am a prospective pharmacist who will obtain a license, my ultimate goal is paradoxically to \'prevent people from going to pharmacies.\' Through Wellness Box, I want to create a \'preventive health management culture\' that helps people stay healthy before they get sick.\"\n\nFounded: December 2024\n\nMain business: AI-powered, pharmacy-based platform for customized, small-batch nutritional supplement delivery\n\nAchievements: Selected as a finalist for the 2025 Pre-Startup Package (Kwangwoon University); Selected as a finalist for the 2025 Startup-Oriented University (Hanyang University); Selected as a finalist for the 2025 New Business Entrepreneurship Academy (Incheon); Selected for the VC Batch Program (SEED investment) and won the main prize at the Gwacheon Startup Competition (competition rate: 20:1); Selected to participate in the Hongneung Innopolis Campus Project; Selected as a tenant company for the Seoul Campus Town project (Kyung Hee University, Kwangwoon University, and Yonsei University); Exceeded the beta test sales target; Selected as a presenting team for the Challenge K-Startup 2025 Student League; and Currently awaiting the final round of the BonAngels Venture Partners Batch\n\nreporter jinho lee\n\njinho2323@hankyung.com\n\nKyung Hee 와우넷 오늘장전략 좋아요 00 싫어요 00 후속기사 원해요 00\n\n관련뉴스', 'https://img.hankyung.com/photo/202507/AD.41117210.1.jpg', 'https://www.wowtv.co.kr/NewsCenter/News/Read?articleId=202507147817d', 'Wow TV', NULL, 'dmoz/Shopping/Health, dmoz/Business/Healthcare, dmoz/Health/Pharmacy, dmoz/Health/Pharmacy/Prescription Services, news/Technology', '2025-07-14 06:52:25', '2025-07-14 06:55:21', '2025-07-14 06:55:21'),

The poll seeks feedback on the Advisory Committee\'s four proposed plans to take Libya to elections, preconditions for a successful power transfer, and ways to guarantee progress - among other things. The data collected, along with the outcomes of in-person consultations across the country, will be used to inform the development of the roadmap for the next step of the political process.\n\n\"Public participation is crucial to ensuring a Libyan-led, Libyan-owned political process,\" said Special Representative of the Secretary-General Hanna Tetteh. \"We want Libyans from all walks of life, across the country to share their opinions and ideas.

Libyans from the south and east are especially urged to join the conversation.\n\nIn addition to online polling, the Mission will also be undertaking two telephone surveys, delivered through third parties, to ensure that as many people as possible are included in the process.\n\nAmong those who have responded to the poll so far, the largest share indicated that they see unifying state institutions and eliminating political division as the most urgent issues to address, followed by security sector reform.\n\nWhen asked how the political division affects their life, respondents indicated their top two concerns were the security situation and a lack of rule of law and accountability for human rights violations.\n\n\"There is no proper education or healthcare, and every day there is a shortage of services - especially in areas where no party has clear influence,\" wrote a student from Tripoli. \"Every area is ruled by a group or militia, and we don\'t know anyone we can turn to in times of hardship.

Then, there is no real justice or accountability.\"\n\nIn addition to voting on their favourite of the Advisory Committee\'s four proposed roadmaps, more than 3,000 people submitted written ideas to strengthen the political process.

I want parliamentary elections for a new national assembly with two chambers so that the House of Representatives does not monopolize power.\"\n\n\"I believe a permanent constitution will pave the way for fair and free, democratic elections,\" wrote an Al Kufra man, voicing support for Option 3, which calls for the adoption of a permanent constitution prior to any elections. This is critical, a Tripoli man wrote, because \"the constitution will decide whether the governmental system is a presidential, monarchy or parliamentary system.\"\n\nAnother man from Tripoli voted for the Advisory Committee\'s fourth option, which proposed a political dialogue forum be launched to establish new transitional arrangements for elections in line with Article 64 of the Libyan Political Agreement, because, he wrote, \"of the difficulty of holding elections and unifying the military and security establishment, and the fear that the results will not be accepted by the parties that possess weapons.\" Appointing a constituent assembly, he wrote, would help to \"enforce election results.\"\n\nAsked about their priority for a political roadmap, respondents were equally divided among the importance of political feasibility, avoiding the extension of transitional periods, and establishing the fastest road to elections.\n\nOne respondent from Azzawya underlined the need to \"restore trust between the people and the state.\"\n\n\"All parties must be compelled to make concessions for the sake of the country,\" wrote a respondent from Ghiryan.\n\nResults are preliminary.\n\nDistributed by APO Group on behalf of United Nations Support Mission in Libya (UNSMIL).', NULL, 'https://www.zawya.com/en/press-release/africa-press-releases/united-nations-support-mission-in-libya-unsmil-public-poll-hits-10-000-responses-add-your-voice-rgsacwy7', 'Zawya.com', NULL, 'dmoz/Society/Politics, dmoz/Society/Politics/Campaigns and Elections, dmoz/Society/Activism/Strategies, dmoz/Society/Politics/Democracy, dmoz/Society/Issues/Online Issues Polls, news/Politics', '2025-07-14 06:36:04', '2025-07-14 06:55:21', '2025-07-14 06:55:21'),

But the dress is not what everyone is talking about; it is her handbag, which had Labubus hanging on it.\n\nApart from the dress, Urvashi\'s timeless Hermes Birkin handbag grabbed more attention of netizens.

The decision in Aquarion Water Company of Connecticut v. Public Utilities Regulatory Authority results in significant savings for the water utility\'s customers upon implementation.\n\n\"Today\'s (July 9) ruling by the state\'s highest court adopts several arguments made by my office throughout the appeals process,\" Coleman said in a press release. \"Utilities must meet their burden of proof to show customers are benefiting from the investments that customers pay for on their bills, and in this case Aquarion came up short.\"\n\nAquarion\'s original rate increase request of $247.43 million over three years with a return on equity (ROE) of 10.35% would have resulted in an increase of roughly 9% or $61 per year to the average residential water customer. PURA\'s decision allowed the company only $195.5 million with an ROE of 8.7% - resulting in roughly $67 a year below the company\'s request.\n\nTo protect this pro-consumer decision challenged by the company in April 2023, the Office of Consumer Counsel intervened in the company\'s appeal before the Connecticut Superior Court. On March 26, 2024, the court largely upheld PURA\'s original decision citing key arguments OCC raised, including that the regulator can properly consider all relevant statutory standards when evaluating requests for cost recovery.\n\nIn the July 9 decision, the Supreme Court affirmed nearly every aspect of PURA\'s original decision. The court affirmed that PURA\'s reduction to the company\'s requested profits would not unconstitutionally diminish the company\'s financial integrity or deprive it of its ability to attract capital. The decision also remanded a minor technical issue back to PURA for reconsideration - a total of $1.5 million of Aquarion\'s nearly $50 million request.\n\nThe decision becomes effective July 15 and will lift the court-ordered stay on these rates for Aquarion customers, who can expect to see bill savings based on original estimates.', 'https://westfaironline.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/ColemanOCC.png', 'https://westfaironline.com/fairfield/state-consumer-counsel-coleman-applauds-aquarion-water-court-decision/', 'Westfair Communications', 'Gary Larkin', 'dmoz/Society/Law/Legal Information, dmoz/Society/Issues/Business, dmoz/Society/Law/Services, dmoz/Society/Law/Employment, news/Business', '2025-07-14 06:45:06', '2025-07-14 06:55:22', '2025-07-14 06:55:22'),

It\'ll be a homecoming for Rory McIlroy, who will be looking for both his second British Open title and his second major win of the season after winning the Masters in April. The latest 2025 Open Championship odds via FanDuel list McIlroy as the second favorite at +700.\n\nPGA Championship winner Scottie Scheffler is the +450 favorite in the latest PGA odds. Other top Open Championship contenders include Jon Rahm (+1200) and Bryson DeChambeau (+2000), with reigning British Open champion Xander Schauffele (+2500) and Ludvig Aberg (+2800) also in the mix. Scottish Open champion Chris Gotterup is a +9000 longshot. Before locking in your 2025 Open Championship picks, be sure to see the golf predictions and projected leaderboard from the proven computer model at SportsLine.\n\nSportsLine\'s proprietary model, built by DFS pro Mike McClure, has been red-hot since the PGA Tour resumed in June 2020. In fact, the model is up over $8,500 on its best bets since the restart, nailing tournament after tournament.\n\nThis same model has also nailed a whopping 15 majors entering the weekend, including the 2025 Masters -- its fourth Masters in a row -- and the 2025 PGA Championship. Anyone who has followed its sports betting picks could have seen massive returns on betting sites. New users have the opportunity to take advantage of the latest FanDuel promo code, DraftKings promo code and Fanatics Sportsbook promo code.\n\nNow that the 2025 Open Championship field is locked in, SportsLine simulated the tournament 10,000 times, and the results were surprising. Head to SportsLine now to see the projected leaderboard.\n\nOne major surprise the model is calling for at the 2025 Open Championship: McIlroy, a five-time major champion and one of the top favorites, stumbles and barely cracks the top five. McIlroy won The Open in 2014 but missed the cut in his last Open Championship start a year ago. He also missed the cut in his only other visit to Royal Portrush, which came at the 2019 British Open.\n\nSince completing the career Grand Slam at the Masters earlier this year, McIlroy\'s form hasn\'t kept pace in his ensuing major starts or on the PGA Tour as a whole. He finished 47th at the PGA Championship and 19th at the U.S. Open, marking just the second time over the last dozen years he had finishes outside the top 15 in consecutive major starts. He\'s not a strong pick to win it all, and there are far better values in the 2025 Open Championship field. See who else to fade here.\n\nAnother surprise: Justin Thomas, a 50-1 longshot, makes a strong run at the title. He has a much better chance to win it all than his odds imply, so he\'s a target for anyone looking for a huge payday. The British Open has traditionally not been the strongest event for Thomas, who is still looking for his first career top-10 finish in this tournament.\n\nThomas, however, has been playing some of his best golf of the past few years recently. He won the RBC Heritage, a Signature Event, in April. He also recorded top-10 finishes at the Travelers Championship and the Truist Championship since that point. The model has identified him as a top-10 contender at Royal Portrush, making him a strong pick for Open outright and top-10 bets. See who else to pick here.\n\nThe model is also targeting three other golfers with odds of 22-1 or longer who will make a strong run at the title. Anyone who backs these longshots could hit it big. You can only see the model\'s picks here.\n\nWho will win the 2025 Open Championship, and which longshots will stun the golfing world?

At its center is the 7-inch (17.8 cm) LCD screen, which displays all the important information, such as program number, elapsed time, speed in miles per hour, incline level (degrees), calories burned, and distance in miles.\n\nThe remainder of the control center has all the buttons for the various settings. Buttons to start and pause/stop the treadmill, select the pre-programmed workout routines, and pre-set values for incline and speed. Also, like the handrails, the incline level and speed can be increased and decreased incrementally.\n\nThere are also two cup holders and a little trim piece to support a book, tablet, phone, TV remote, etc.\n\nThe treadmill deck is cushioned in several areas to make exercising comfortable and easier on your knees. The treadmill belt has a slight texture to aid in grip.\n\nThe treadmill has a few safety features worth noting. First is the quick stop safety cord. It is magnetically attached to the control center and has a clip for your clothes. If you fall, the clip will detach and stop the treadmill immediately.\n\nThe places on the treadmill where the belt operates are covered and protected to keep fingers or toes from getting caught or injured.\n\nThe treadmill starts up at 0.5 mph (0.8 kph). A nice leisurely pace to get warmed up. Pressing the +/- buttons on the right handlebar or the up/down buttons on the control center increases the speed by 1/10th mph at a time, up to 8.5 (13.9 kph). You can also use the 1, 3, 5, or 7 buttons (top row of numeric buttons) to quickly set the speed to that speed in miles per hour.\n\nThe treadmill always starts at the 0º incline (flat). As you increase the incline, 1º at a time, the front of the deck rises slowly. This will require more effort and thus be a more and more difficult workout. You can also use the 3, 6, 9, or 12 buttons (second row of numeric buttons) to quickly set the incline level to 3º, 6º, 9º, or 12º. When the treadmill is stopped or shut off, it returns to the 0º (flat) position.\n\nThe OHWILL Auto Incline Treadmill has 15 pre-programmed workout routines. 12 of these routines are shown on the control center on the left and right sides of the screen. These routines are all different 30-minute workouts that are of varying speeds and inclinations. The treadmill adjusts them automatically as you work out. There is a table in the instructions describing the changes in speed and incline for each of the 15 routines. (The control center only shows 12 illustrations, but the treadmill has 15 pre-programmed routines).\n\nThe treadmill has a feature to calculate your BMI (body mass index) by inputting your values for gender, age, height, and weight.\n\nShould the treadmill belt become off-centered on the rollers, there are adjustment screws on the end of the deck. Using a special Allen wrench, the belt\'s position on the rollers can be adjusted left and right to recenter it. Also, a small bottle of lubricant is supplied to oil the underside of the belt. This is recommended to be done occasionally, based on how often the treadmill is used.\n\nOne of the major features of the OHWILL Auto Incline Treadmill is the ability to fold up the deck and move it out of the way when it\'s not being used. After pulling up on the end of the deck toward the control center, it will lock in the upright position. The entire treadmill can then be tilted back and rolled away. Watch the video below for a better sense of folding and moving the treadmill.\n\nThe OHWILL Auto Incline Treadmill was delivered in a very large and heavy box (about 110 lbs) that the FedEx delivery person was not too happy to put on my porch. Opening it revealed how well it was packaged and protected during its journey from China.\n\nThe detailed steps were very well laid out, and the broken English instructions were clear enough to follow. I didn\'t have any issues along the way, and all of the included tools the hardware were very well arranged.\n\n7 steps and 16 screws/washers later, and the assembly was completed. It took about 30 minutes to assemble the treadmill.\n\nThe OHWILL Auto Incline Treadmill performed great for its price point and feature set. I did not have a single issue with the machine. The controls were easy and intuitive.\n\nWalking on the treadmill was comfortable, and the belt never stuck or made any scraping or binding noises. The deck is cushioned, so it was easy on my old, tired knees. My daughter used it to run on, and it performed well for her.\n\nWorkouts can be accomplished in one of several ways. Just hit start and adjust the speed and incline. Walk/jog/run as much as you want. I could also set a time or distance limit (e.g., 5 miles) before beginning. After pressing start, the display will count down until your workout is finished. Using the pre-programmed routines was also a preferred workout method for me. Select one and start. Couldn\'t be any easier.\n\nOne issue I did find was pausing a workout. After pausing and then hitting start to resume, the previous speed and inline settings were not resumed. I would think it should resume back to the previous settings after a short amount of time, but it did not, or I couldn\'t figure out how to get it to do that. The instructions did not say how to do it.\n\nThe safety cord is a nice feature. Yanking the cord off the control center would stop the belt very quickly. It\'s jarring to stop that quickly, so don\'t play with it while working out. Don\'t ask me how I know.\n\nFor the most part, the display is great and displays a lot of information. However, in certain light, it was a little hard to read. Maybe it\'s my height and the angle I was reading it from. It\'s not a huge issue, I just found myself adjusting my angle of eyesight to see all the numbers.\n\nSince the belt has a texture, I found walking on it without socks or shoes was rough on my feet. So, socks at least are recommended.\n\nThe BMI calculator is nice, but I could not see where the treadmill used that information for anything except to calculate it. I thought maybe it would recommend a pre-programmed setting based on the BMI number.\n\nFolding the treadmill is very easy as long as you can lift about 15-20 pounds to about chest height. Tilting the treadmill back is fairly easy, as it is weight-balanced pretty well. Rolling the little wheels across the carpet was tough, but not too bad.\n\nThe OHWILL Auto Incline Treadmill is a very good, inexpensive treadmill for the home. Does it have all the bells and whistles of other treadmills? No. It\'s not designed for that. It\'s a basic, well-performing treadmill that will give you the same workout a more feature-packed one would give. I think it will be a good tool for maybe getting me in a little better shape.', 'https://the-gadgeteer.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/ohwill-autoinclinetreadmill-01.jpg', 'https://the-gadgeteer.com/2025/07/14/ohwill-auto-incline-treadmill-review-walking-miles-in-my-house/', 'The Gadgeteer', 'Pat Henderson', 'dmoz/Recreation/Humor, dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Useless Pages, dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out, dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Interactive, dmoz/Home/Homemaking/Cleaning and Stains, news/Health', '2025-07-14 07:00:18', '2025-07-14 07:04:22', '2025-07-14 07:04:22'),

But Trump, a big supporter of the royal family, was hosted by Charles\' late mother, Queen Elizabeth II in 2019.\n\nOn this occasion however, he will not stay at Buckingham Palace, which is currently undergoing renovations. Instead, he will travel to Windsor Castle which sits around 30 miles to the west of Britain\'s capital, London.\n\nTrump who shocked reporters and palace pundits in 2018 when he breached royal protocol by walking ahead of the queen, at times blocking her view and giving her his back, said it was a \"great, great honor\" when the U.K.\'s Prime Minister Keir Starmer hand-delivered the invitation during a visit to the White House in February.\n\n\"That\'s really something,\" he added.\n\nSecond-term U.S. presidents who have already made a state visit to the U.K. normally take lunch or tea with the monarch, as was the case with George W. Bush and Barack Obama. Meanwhile, state visits are ceremonial meetings between heads of state that are used to honor friendly nations and sometimes smooth relations between rivals.\n\nAlthough the king formally issues the invitation for a state visit, which comes with a full display of pageantry and royal pomp, he does so on the advice of the government.\n\nThe announcement comes as Starmer courts Trump\'s favor on tariff negotiations, which have thrown a wrench in the Labour government\'s efforts to grow the U.K. economy after it contracted in April amid a record fall in exports to the United States.\n\nTrump last month lowered tariffs on the U.K. aerospace sector to zero, but imports of British steel products continue to face a 25% duty.\n\nOn his last visit to the U.K., Trump injected himself into British politics by endorsing Boris Johnson to be the next prime minister and weighed in on negotiations over Brexit. He also continued his public feud with London Mayor Sadiq Khan, branding him a loser.\n\nCharles could also face challenges with Trump on Canada, since he\'s also the head of state for the former British colony. Trump has on several occasions threatened to annex Canada and suggested it should become the 51st U.S. state.\n\nCanada\'s Prime Minister Mark Carney criticized the state visit invite in May.\n\nIn a speech to Canada\'s parliament in May, the monarch highlighted the country\'s \"sovereignty\" and said it was facing a \"critical moment.\"\n\n\"The true north is indeed strong and free,\" Charles said, referring to Canada\'s national anthem.', 'https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_nbcnews-fp-1024-512,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2025-07/250714-charles-and-trump-rs-c1ad8f.jpg', 'https://www.nbcnews.com/world/united-kingdom/trump-make-unprecedented-second-state-visit-uk-september-rcna218597', 'NBC News', NULL, 'dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare and Conflict, dmoz/Home/Personal Finance/Unclaimed Money, dmoz/Society/Politics/Monarchy, dmoz/Society/History/Historical Personages, news/Politics', '2025-07-14 06:51:05', '2025-07-14 07:04:22', '2025-07-14 07:04:22'),

But a Scottish mum recently discovered that sun cream doesn\'t always work, as her baby daughter was \'severely\' burned recently despite wearing factor 50.\n\nLauren Leishman had taken her 12-month-old Rhegan on a family day out to a farm show in Haddington, East Lothian, on Saturday, June 28. Despite applying factor 50 sun cream \'just to be safe\', the tot ended up with a red blistered face and hands, and was rushed to the Royal Hospital for Children & Young People in Edinburgh.\n\nThe 22-year-old mum had used Malibu Kids Factor 50 sun cream, which was labelled as \'high protection\' and \'clinically proven to be kind to skin\'. But after browsing Facebook, Lauren found that others had found similar problems with this brand of sun cream.\n\nSo, how can you check that the sun cream you use will actually work? Here\'s everything you need to know.\n\nMost SPF products have a shelf life of up to three years, but a sun cream that has expired will not be as effective at protecting you or your child\'s skin, according to skincare website Paula\'s Choice.\n\nAlways check the expiration date on the bottle before using, and examine the consistency of the sun cream for any changes- for example, if it has turned more watery or grainy- to make sure it hasn\'t gone off.\n\nUVA sun rays are always present during daylight hours, and can penetrate through clouds or even glass. This type of sun ray can cause lasting damage and skin cancer, and contributes to skin aging and sun spots.\n\nIn 1992, Boots developed the UVA star rating, which was Europe\'s first measurement system for UVA protection. Ranging from zero to five, this rating indicates the percentage of UVA radiation that\'s absorbed by the brand of sun cream in question.\n\nThe amount of UVA radiation absorbed is compared to that of UVB radiation, which is another type of sun ray that causes skin burning. The higher the star rating, the better the protection against UVA rays.\n\nThe lowest recommended star rating for UVA protection is four, so be mindful to always check your sun cream for a high UVA rating.\n\nThere are plenty of kids\' sun creams with high UVA ratings, such as the Riemann P20 Sun cream/lotion for Kids. This sun cream has a UVA rating of five and is available on Amazon for a 20 per cent discount at £15.99.\n\nBoots\' entire Soltan range of sun creams have a UVA rating of five, including the Soltan Kids Protect & Moisturise Lotion SPF50+, available on their website for £5.50, or the Soltan Clear & Cool Protect Suncare Mist SPF50+ for adults which is £9.50 on their website.\n\nAlternatively, for adults, Amazon offers the discounted La-Roche-Posay Anthelios UVAir Daily SPF50+ Sunscreen, which is labelled as having high UVA and UVB protection, for £19.97.\n\nSPF, or \'sun protection factor\', indicates the level of protection a sun cream provides against burning rays, explains the Boots website.\n\nSPF refers to how well the product reduces the burning effect of the sun on your skin. For example, if you usually begin to burn after 10 minutes in the sun, applying an SPF 15 sunscreen will protect you for 15 times longer than that, meaning you are protected for up to 150 minutes.\n\nBut as Lauren saw, some products that are labelled with a higher SPF may not work as well as others, so it\'s best to also check the UVA rating of your sun cream. A combination of a high SPF and UVA rating of four or five stars is recommended for maximum sun protection.\n\nProducts need to be applied every two hours and after being in water to help maintain protection.\n\nIf you\'re intending to spend longer in the sun, then you should choose a product higher SPF and UVA rating to begin with.', 'https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/article35552177.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_Sun-cream.jpg', 'https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/lifestyle/how-check-sunscreen-protect-your-35551625', 'Daily Record', 'Rachel Cronin', 'dmoz/Home/Family/Pregnancy, dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out, dmoz/Shopping/Health/Children and Adolescents, dmoz/Shopping/Health/Substance Abuse, news/Health', '2025-07-14 07:03:06', '2025-07-14 07:04:22', '2025-07-14 07:04:22'),

For eight years, she had hidden from authorities, ove', 'In a tale that seems more like folklore than fact, a Russian woman named Nina Kutina was discovered living deep in the forests of Karnataka\'s Uttara Kannada district along with her two young daughters. For eight years, she had hidden from authorities, overstaying her visa and embracing a life of spiritual solitude. Her story, now unfolding publicly, is both heart-wrenching and extraordinary. What began as a search for peace turned into an unprecedented survival journey, bringing to light one of the most unusual immigration violations in recent years.\n\nThe cave in which Russian Woman, Nina lived was located in a treacherous zone prone to landslides one had occurred there just a year earlier. Despite the danger, Nina was unfazed. When officials warned her about venomous snakes, she replied calmly, \"Snakes are our friends; they don\'t harm us unless we trouble them.\"\n\nHer children had grown up without modern conveniences. They had never seen electric lights or slept on beds until the police temporarily housed them in an ashram. Living by candlelight and natural cycles, Nina had managed to accumulate supplies and lived an ascetic life. She charged her phone only during occasional visits to nearby towns to buy groceries.\n\nIn the cave, she created a nurturing environment for her children, complete with daily routines of yoga, mantra chanting, drawing, and singing. The police found numerous photos of happy moments on her phone, revealing a life rooted deeply in spiritual values, even amid hardship.\n\nRussian Woman, Nina Kutina, 40, first arrived in India in 2016 on a business visa, engaging in the tourism and restaurant sectors of Goa and Gokarna. However, her visa expired on April 17, 2017. Rather than return to Russia, she chose to vanish into the forests. She received an exit permit in 2018, briefly visited Nepal, and quietly re-entered India later that year, settling deep in the Ramatirtha hills of Kumta taluk.\n\nAvoiding hotels and public spaces out of fear of detection, Nina found solace in the forests. She meditated, worshipped, and lived off minimal supplies. Her two daughters Prema (6) and Ama (4) -- were born in India during this period, reportedly inside the forest. Authorities are still investigating the circumstances of their births, as Nina has not disclosed the father\'s identity or whether medical care was involved.\n\nSub-Inspector Sridhar S R of Gokarna Police stumbled upon Nina and her daughters on July 9, 2025, during a patrol to ensure tourist safety. A trail of footprints led them to a cave adorned with plastic sheeting and pictures of Hindu deities. Inside, the officers found a peaceful scene: one child playing, the other asleep beside their mother.\n\nFollowing their discovery, Nina and her daughters were taken to an ashram run by Swami Yogaratna Saraswati in Bankikodla village. The transition was emotionally difficult. On July 13, Nina sent an emotional WhatsApp message in Russian to a friend and a police officer:\n\n\"We were put in a prison without sky, without grass, without waterfalls. On an icy hard floor we now sleep \'to protect us from rain and snakes\'. I want to be with you in the forest, under the open sky, surrounded by nature.\"\n\nThe message, filled with sorrow and longing, painted a vivid picture of how deeply Nina had bonded with India\'s forests. The idea of returning to Russia felt like exile to a woman who had built her world among trees and streams.\n\nDespite her pleas, legal procedures are now underway. The Gokarna police have contacted the Foreigners Regional Registration Office (FRRO) in Bengaluru. The family is expected to be deported soon. Police remain tight-lipped about the potential involvement of others, especially regarding the children\'s paternity and whether Nina received help during childbirth.\n\nDuring preliminary questioning, Nina insisted her documents were lost, but officials later found them in the cave. It was then confirmed that she had intentionally overstayed in India and re-entered illegally after her Nepal trip. Her case, though violating immigration laws, is being handled with compassion, particularly because of the children involved.', 'https://tfipost.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Untitled_design_16_1_optimized_1000-1.jpg', 'https://tfipost.com/2025/07/feared-humans-not-snakes-how-a-russian-woman-lived-8-years-in-karnataka-forests-with-her-kids/', 'TFIPOST', 'Harishanker R P', 'dmoz/Society/Death, dmoz/Society/Death/In Memoriam, news/Politics', '2025-07-14 06:59:09', '2025-07-14 07:04:22', '2025-07-14 07:04:22'),

Sen. Bernie Moreno (R-OH) has noted that Powell has somehow found his voice in this administration, while he remained curiously silent during the Biden-Harris administration, despite ballooning inflation and the economic fallout and small business closures due to the COVID shutdowns. Like Trump, Moreno has gone on the record to call for Powell\'s resignation.\n\nREAD MORE: Fed Housing Director Calls for Immediate Investigation of Jerome Powell for Lying to Congress\n\nSen Bernie Moreno Exposes Fed Chair Jerome Powell As a Hypocrite: \'Should Resign\'\n\nFederal Housing Finance Administration (FHFA) Director Bill Pulte says Powell has lied about the details of the $2.5 billion renovation to the Federal Reserve building and is calling for an investigation over it, as well as Powell\'s political bias and deceptive testimony before the Senate. According to reports, this whiff of malfeasance would be grounds for Trump to fire Powell, but the president is insistent on seeing him resign.\n\nDespite rumors swirling that Powell is mulling resignation, from all appearances, he is in for the long haul. But \"Art of the Troll\" Trump has kept the pressure on \"Too Late\" Powell, using his words and persuasion tactics to erode the Fed chair\'s reputation and confidence.\n\nSEE ALSO: Trump Masterfully Trolls Fed Chairman \'Too Late\' Powell Over Interest Rates, Pens Hand-Written Note\n\nAfter his return from the FIFA Club World Cup in New Jersey, Trump continued the campaign, telling reporters on the tarmac at Joint Base Andrews that Powell has been \"very bad for the country.\"\n\nWATCH:\n\nI think that if Jerome Powell stepped down, it would be a great thing, I don\'t know if he\'s going to, but he should.\n\nJerome Powell has been very bad for our country. We should have the lowest interest rate on earth, and we don\'t. He just refuses to do it, and yet he\'s spending 2.5 billion dollars rebuilding the Fed, the Federal Reserve building. And I don\'t know what he knows about building, but you talk about cost overruns.\n\nSo, we got this approved, and he started the work during the Biden administration, and he doesn\'t look like the kind of a guy, frankly that wants to spend 2.5 billion dollars. And it\'s very interesting, becaause out of 71 economists, one person--me--and then one other person. I think from Wharton got it right, and the other ones were wrong. In terms of the success of our country this quickly. We have no inflation. We have cash pouring in. It was me, and somebody else. Then, I can tell you, I don\'t need 5,000 people working for me behind the scenes like Jerome Powell to tell him what he should say once a month, because they got it wrong. The Fed got it wrong. I call him \"Too Late.\" He\'s always too late.\n\nEvery point costs us 360 billion dollars. Think of that. And we should be three points -- That\'s almost a trillion dollars, approximately a trillion dollars less we should be, just by the signing of a piece of paper.\n\nSo, we\'ll see what happens. I mean, you\'re telling me he\'s going to quit. I hope he quits. I don\'t know if he\'s going to quit, but he should quit, because he\'s been very bad for the country.\n\nClub for Growth founder and Trump loyalist Stephen Moore sides with Trump on the need for interest rate reduction, while pointing out that despite its claims of being politically independent, the economists at the Fed have aligned 90 percent with the Democrat Party. The fact that Powell chose to cut interest rates in September 2024, right before the November elections, indicates that his moves are more partisan than independent. These are also the sentiments of CEO of Azoria Investments James Fishback.\n\nTrump is right about Powell.\n\nInflation just hit a 4-year low -- and it\'s heading even lower. So why is Jerome Powell (Too Late!) keeping interest rates near 20-year highs?\n\nHe claims he can\'t cut now, but he had no issue cutting rates by 50 points right before the election when inflation was higher than it is today.\n\nPowell is not fighting inflation. He\'s fighting Trump.\n\nWe know Trump enjoys the fight, but bureaucratic elitists like Powell lack the pugilistic instinct. With pressure being applied from the executive, the legislature, and Wall Street, we will see whether Powell will return the fight or ultimately fold.\n\nEditor\'s Note: Thanks to President Trump\'s leadership and bold policies, America\'s economy is back on track.\n\nHelp us continue to report on the president\'s economic successes and combat the lies of the Democrats.

(279, 'Trump\'s copper tariff is a first step. Here\'s what\'s needed now to counter China.', 'America must control its copper supply - but Washington doesn\'t have many chances to get it right\n\nThe U.S. copper industry is in crisis - and Washington is finally taking notice.\n\nWith President Donald Trump\'s recent announcement of 50% tariffs on copper', 'America must control its copper supply - but Washington doesn\'t have many chances to get it right\n\nThe U.S. copper industry is in crisis - and Washington is finally taking notice.\n\nWith President Donald Trump\'s recent announcement of 50% tariffs on copper (HG00) imports under Section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act, the United States has correctly identified copper as a material of strategic national importance.\n\nThis is an encouraging first step. It safeguards U.S. copper mills from a flood of underpriced imports taking advantage of a broken market structure. For months, speculators and foreign competitors have been exploiting a growing price gap between the U.S. and global copper markets.\n\nThe benchmark price for copper in the United States, set by the COMEX exchange, has surged well above the global price set by the London Metal Exchange (LME). This gap - known as the COMEX-LME spread - has exploded by more than 100% since February, triggering a wave of arbitrage that is flooding the U.S. market with imported copper.\n\nMeanwhile, speculative traders are buying cheap LME-priced copper abroad and rushing it into the U.S. to capitalize on the spread. In April alone, the U.S. imported more than 200,000 metric tons of refined copper- a modern record. COMEX warehouse inventories are at five-year highs. At the same time, U.S. imports of various copper-mill products (for example, bars, rods and profiles) have spiked by 2.8 million metric tonnes (52%) since February, according to the U.S. Census Bureau.\n\nFurther, because of limited domestic U.S. production of refined copper - the principal raw material for copper mills - U.S. mills rely on imports at inflated, COMEX-based prices.\n\nTo make matters worse, China - already the world\'s largest copper refiner - is flooding the global market with excess supply. Its state-backed smelters have overbuilt to such an extent that they\'re now operating at a loss just to maintain output. Refining fees have gone negative. This oversupply is dragging global copper prices even lower, while U.S. prices remain artificially high.\n\nThis combination of factors - COMEX-LME arbitrage, Chinese overproduction, and predatory pricing - is decimating U.S. copper mills. Simply put, foreign suppliers are undercutting American producers in their own market.\n\nToday, copper is more vital than ever. It is powering America\'s transition to clean-energy technologies such as electric vehicles, and it undergirds emerging technologies, including AI, advanced computing and data centers. It also plays a vital role in defense systems and power-grid modernization.\n\nIf America cedes control of its copper supply chain, it risks becoming dependent on geopolitical rivals for the very material that underpins its energy independence, national security and technological leadership.\n\nThe Trump administration understands the stakes, but getting the policy right means avoiding unintended consequences. For starters, refined copper cathode should be exempted from tariffs to ensure U.S. fabricators can still access the feedstock they need to compete.\n\nNext, the administration should combine 50% tariffs with an additional tariff of $0.40/lb (or $880/ metric ton) to close the COMEX-LME arbitrage window.\n\nThis arrangement, better known as a \"compound tariff,\" is critical because it targets the volume-driven nature of the arbitrage. Value-based tariffs alone rise and fall with price, which can be gamed when global copper prices fluctuate. A fixed per-pound surcharge sets a floor that helps to eliminate the price loophole that traders and foreign competitors have been exploiting for months.\n\nHowever, tariffs alone won\'t solve the problem. The U.S. must also invest in domestic smelting and refining capacity, and consider a ban on copper scrap exports to preserve key raw materials - just as China already does.\n\nAdditionally, the U.S. must confront one of the largest bottlenecks in the system: permitting. It takes an average of 29 years to permit a new copper mine in the U.S. - longer than almost anywhere else in the world. That must change.\n\nRead: Buy this stock if you want exposure to Trump\'s proposed copper tariff\n\nCopper is not just another commodity. It\'s the backbone of the transition to clean energy. It\'s essential to electric vehicles, solar panels, data centers and defense systems. If the U.S. loses the ability to produce copper domestically, it loses control over its energy, economy and national security.\n\nAmerica\'s copper industry doesn\'t need a bailout. It needs smart policy and a fair fight. Washington has taken the first step. Now it must finish the job.\n\nMihir Torsekar is a senior economist at the Coalition for a Prosperous America, which represents U.S. producers and workers.\n\nMore: Where\'s the inflation from tariffs?

He entered the U.S. Capitol with his wife, Jeanette Mangia, where the couple was seen inside Speaker Nancy Pelosi\'s office and the Senate Chamber. Prosecutors say they rifled through documents and took photos, including one of Mangia sitting in former U.S. Sen. Pat Toomey\'s chair.\n\nWhen Capitol Police tried to remove them, Pastucci shoved an officer, and Mangia kicked another in the groin. The pair briefly exited the building but reentered through the Rotunda and joined a crowd pushing against police, according to the FBI.\n\nThe couple was arrested on April 27, 2023, after authorities received an anonymous tip. Pastucci was convicted on all 11 federal charges in a bench trial, but a judge later vacated 10 of them following a Department of Justice motion. In December 2024, he was sentenced on the remaining felony. The following month, President Donald J. Trump issued a sweeping pardon to all individuals charged or convicted in connection with the Capitol riot, which included Pastucci.\n\nMangia\'s charges were dismissed without prejudice on Jan. 22, 2025. In her opinion, U.S. District Judge Beryl A. Howell condemned the presidential proclamation that labeled the prosecutions a \"national injustice,\" writing: \"That merely raises the dangerous specter of future lawless conduct by other sore losers and undermines the rule of law.\" Despite the court\'s strong language, the judge acknowledged that the prosecution had the authority to drop the case and ordered the dismissal .\n\nWhile Pastucci\'s federal charges were being resolved, he was also facing six charges in York County -- including rape, aggravated indecent assault, sexual assault, stalking, indecent assault, and false imprisonment -- stemming from a July 1, 2023, domestic incident in Fairview Township.\n\nThe woman who made the allegations told police that Pastucci raped her in his home and wouldn\'t allow her to leave. She said he had become increasingly controlling, frequently accused her of infidelity, and allegedly placed a tracking device on her car to monitor her movements. Pastucci told police the sex was consensual and claimed he took her car keys to prevent her from driving drunk.\n\nOn July 7, 2025, the York County District Attorney\'s Office filed a motion to nolle prosse all charges, stating that their office had been unable to reach the victim despite months of attempts. \"Without the victim\'s cooperation, the commonwealth cannot prove these charges beyond a reasonable doubt,\" Chief Deputy District Attorney Rachel Sherman wrote in the filing, as reported by PennLive.\n\nA victim/witness coordinator reportedly sent a final text to the woman warning that the case would be dropped if they didn\'t hear back. She did not respond. Judge Amber Kraft granted the motion the same day, officially closing the case.\n\nDaily Voice has reached out to the York County District Attorney\'s Office, Pastucci, and the court for comment but has not yet received a response.\n\nCharges dropped under nolle prosequi may still be refiled at a later date.

Paris Saint-Germain, football\'s neon-lit superpower, armed with more wealth than entire leagues and an attack so fearsome some pundits believed the game was over before it had even begun.\n\nBut football has never cared for balance sheets alone.\n\nAs Chelsea\'s Reece James lifted the gold-glinting FIFA Club World Cup trophy, the scene replayed a timeless truth of this game: every so often, the mighty do fall, and the world stands up for the ones who dare to dream.\n\nSo, lace up your boots and relive five moments when the underdogs did more than win, they rewrote football\'s greatest scripts.\n\nChelsea 3-0 PSG -- Club World Cup Final, 2025\n\nIt was Cole Palmer who led them, a boyish grin under a mop of hair slick with sweat, arms hugging his body, acting like he was cold, his trademark celebration on a hot July afternoon that made it all cheekier after making it two-nil.\n\nAround him, teammates in royal blue screamed into the roar of 80,000 stunned fans.\n\nNo one expected this. Not when the match kicked off. Not when PSG\'s stars strutted onto the pitch. Not when bookmakers gave Chelsea little more than a polite nod.\n\nBut Palmer\'s brace and João Pedro\'s delicate chip over Donnarumma cracked the illusion. PSG\'s bench was silent.\n\nWhen the final whistle sounded, Chelsea\'s players fell to the grass, kings of the world, at least for one unforgettable night.\n\nChelsea: Champions League Miracle, 2012\n\nThirteen years earlier, Chelsea scripted another of football\'s greatest upsets, one born from chaos and defiance.\n\nIn 2012, Chelsea\'s season was in tatters, their manager sacked halfway through, senior players branded past it, the squad limping through the Premier League in sixth place.\n\nThey should have crumbled when they ran into Napoli, then the mighty Barcelona in the semi-final. But they didn\'t.\n\nAt the Camp Nou, down to ten men, they defended with everything they had. Then, in stoppage time, Fernando Torres, the striker mocked for missing sitters, broke away, rounded Valdés, and rolled the ball home. Gary Neville\'s commentary squeal said it all: \"Unbelievable!\"\n\nThen came the final in Munich, Bayern\'s backyard. Drogba equalised with a thunderbolt header. Čech saved Robben\'s penalty in extra time.\n\nThe shootout? The same man who rescued them before stepped up last. Drogba\'s calm strike delivered Chelsea\'s first ever Champions League, against every logic and every oddsmaker.\n\nLeicester City: Premier League Champions, 2015-16\n\nIf you were in Leicester that May night in 2016, you\'d remember the pubs packed shoulder to shoulder.\n\nGrown men in replica shirts wept into plastic pints. Families poured into the streets, fireworks lighting up the pitch-black Midlands sky.\n\nJust twelve months earlier, Leicester had scraped survival in the Premier League. A club more famous for relegation scraps than silverware, whose striker Jamie Vardy once worked in a factory making carbon splints.\n\nBy May, Vardy was breaking goal records and Claudio Ranieri, a genial Italian once mocked as \"The Tinkerman\", was a champion.\n\nThey didn\'t just win. They sprinted away, finishing 10 points clear while the titans, Manchester City, Chelsea, Arsenal, watched in disbelief.\n\nFor 5,000-to-1 outsiders, it was more than a title. It was proof the impossible still happens when you believe, run, and dare.\n\nGreece: European Champions, 2004\n\nThe summer of 2004 belonged to Portugal, or so everyone thought. Ronaldo, Figo, the party on home soil, it was meant to be their coronation.\n\nBut across hotel TVs and crowded town squares, Europe watched as a disciplined, stubborn band of Greeks redefined defence.\n\nOtto Rehhagel\'s men didn\'t sparkle, they suffocated. They tackled, ran, blocked. And when the chance came, they struck like lightning.\n\nIn the final, Lisbon\'s Stadium of Light glowed under a bruised sunset as 62,000 watched Angelos Charisteas soar above Portuguese defenders to nod in the only goal.\n\nThat single moment, a forehead pressed firmly against a floating cross, sealed the greatest upset European football has seen.\n\nNo golden generation. No galácticos. Just sweat, spirit, and sheer defiance.\n\nZambia: AFCON Champions, 2012\n\nSome underdog stories feel scripted by something bigger than football.\n\nIn 1993, a plane carrying Zambia\'s entire national team crashed into the Atlantic Ocean, just off the coast of Gabon.\n\nAn entire generation of players, gone. Eighteen years later, the Copper Bullets returned to Gabon for the Africa Cup of Nations final, playing not just for themselves, but for ghosts.\n\nOn a balmy Libreville night, under floodlights humming with mosquitoes, they faced Ivory Coast, a heavyweight led by Didier Drogba and packed with stars.\n\nThe match dragged into penalties. Boots scraped earth nervously. The Zambians prayed, sang, then struck each spot kick like a bullet.\n\nWhen Iweala Katongo\'s final penalty rustled the net, the entire squad sprinted to the same stretch of coastline where their brothers fell.\n\nThere they knelt, shirts soaked in sweat and tears, honouring the past while writing a future no one thought possible.\n\nIn football, giants will always rise, the power clubs with bottomless wallets, glittering superstars, and trophies lined up like souvenirs.\n\nBut the soul of the game doesn\'t live there. It lives in nights like Leicester\'s title parade, in Greece\'s stunned silence in Lisbon, in Zambia\'s tearful prayers on a Gabonese beach, and Chelsea silencing the football world.\n\nFKA/MA', NULL, 'https://www.ghanamma.com/2025/07/14/when-underdogs-took-the-football-world-by-storm/', 'GHANA MMA', NULL, 'dmoz/Sports/Soccer, dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Statistics, news/Sports', '2025-07-14 06:37:37', '2025-07-14 07:04:23', '2025-07-14 07:04:23'),

Stroud and Micah Parsons.\n\nThe classic peanut butter and jelly sandwich is getting a modern day upgrade and backing from some top athletes.\n\nJams, a new company created by 26-year-old Connor Blakley, launched Monday and hopes to take on Smucker\'s Uncrustables as the next locker room and lunch box staple. Like Uncrustables, the sandwiches fall in the frozen foods category.\n\nBacked by names like U.S. soccer legend Alex Morgan and NFL Pro Bowlers C.J. Stroud and Micah Parsons, Jams will be available exclusively at 3,000 Walmart stores nationwide.\n\nUncrustables has dominated the market with a near PB&J monopoly, but Blakley is hoping to differentiate his products by appealing to health-conscious consumers.\n\n\"No. 1 is it\'s no seed oils,\" he said. \"We have no dyes, no artificial flavors or colors, no high fructose corn syrup, and we have the most protein per ounce of any peanut butter and jelly that\'s currently on the market.\"\n\nSmucker\'s parent company J.M. Smucker, late last month said it would remove synthetic food colors from all of its consumer food products by the end of 2027.\n\nJams is a slightly larger project than the Smuckers option, at a weight of 74 grams versus Uncrustables\' 58 grams. Blakley also said his product has a lower total sugar content, and each sandwich contains 10 grams of protein.\n\nWalmart also stocks Uncrustables at a $4.34 price point. Jams will cost slightly more at $5.97 per box.\n\nJams will initially be available in two flavors: strawberry and a mixed berry option.\n\nThe entrepreneur, who dropped out of high school when he was 17, said he has taste-tested more than 250 iterations of PB&J sandwiches in the process of developing Jams. The sandwiches are manufactured in Ohio and Wisconsin.\n\nBut Blakley has a steep hill to climb.\n\nIn its most recent earnings call in June, J.M. Smucker said it is on track to generate over a billion dollars in net sales by the end of fiscal 2026 from Uncrustables, noting that they are the No. 1 product in the the total frozen category.\n\nTo support the rising demand, Smucker\'s recently opened its third and largest Uncrustables manufacturing facility in McCalla, Alabama.\n\nBlakley said he believes the key market for his sandwiches will be athletes.\n\nNFL teams consume more than 80,000 Uncrustables per year as a growing number of teams and athletes look for a fast, convenient and filling snack, according to a 2024 report by The Athletic.\n\n\"Athletes want to get the best possible products to fuel their body and lifestyle,\" Blakley said.\n\nHe attributed the success of the peanut butter and jelly sandwich to two things: nostalgia and ease.\n\n\"I think convenience is really, really a big part of why category has and will continue to take off,\" he said.', 'https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/108170899-1752248528862-Connor_Blakley_Jams_Founder.png?v=1752259179&w=1920&h=1080', 'https://www.cnbc.com/2025/07/14/athlete-backed-jams-takes-on-peanut-butter-and-jelly-protein-craze.html', 'CNBC', 'Jessica Golden', 'dmoz/Business/Food and Related Products, dmoz/Business/Food and Related Products/Snack Foods, dmoz/Business/Food and Related Products/Sweeteners, dmoz/Business/Food and Related Products/Wholesale and Distribution, dmoz/Shopping/Food/Health Food, news/Business', '2025-07-14 07:00:01', '2025-07-14 07:04:23', '2025-07-14 07:04:23'),

But he retained a reputation for personal honesty - a rare feat for a politician in Nigeria.\n\nAfter three failed attempts, Buhari achieved a historic victory in 2015, becoming the country\'s first opposition candidate to defeat an incumbent. In 2019, he was re-elected for another four-year term.\n\nBuhari had always been popular among the poor of the north (known as the \"talakawa\" in the Hausa language) but for the 2015 campaign, he had the advantage of a united opposition grouping behind him.\n\nMany of those who supported him thought his military background and disciplinarian credentials were what the country needed to get to grips with the Islamist insurgency in the north. Buhari also promised to tackle corruption and nepotism in government, and create employment opportunities for young Nigerians.\n\nBut his time in office coincided with a slump in global oil prices and the country\'s worst economic crisis in decades.\n\nHis administration also came under fire for its handling of insecurity. While campaigning he had promised to defeat the Islamist militant group Boko Haram. But the group remains a threat and one of its factions is now affiliated to the so-called Islamic State group.\n\nThere was also an upsurge in deadly clashes between farmers and ethnic Fulani herders in central Nigeria. Mr Buhari, a Fulani, was accused of not being tough enough on the herders or doing enough to stop the crisis.\n\nThe activities of so-called bandits in the north-western part of the country saw the abduction of hundreds of secondary school students.\n\nUnder his watch armed forces were accused of human rights abuses - like opening fire on anti-police brutality protesters at the Lekki tollgate in Lagos in October 2020.\n\nMuhammadu Buhari was born in December 1942 in Daura in Katsina state in the far north of Nigeria, near the border with Niger. At the time, Nigeria was controlled by the British and it would be another 18 years before the country gained independence.\n\nBuhari\'s father, who died when he was four, was Fulani, while his mother, who brought him up, was Kanuri. In a 2012 interview, Buhari spoke of being his father\'s 23rd child and his mother\'s 13th. He said his only recollection of his father was of the two of them and one of his half-brothers being thrown from the back of a horse.\n\nThe young Buhari attended primary school in Daura and then boarding school in the city of Katsina. After leaving school, he was admitted to the Nigerian Military Training College, joining the Nigerian army shortly after independence.\n\nBuhari undertook officer training in the UK from 1962-1963 and then began his steady climb up the ranks.\n\nIn later years, Buhari attributed his disciplinarian bent to spending his formative years at boarding school, where corporal punishment was the norm, and in the military. He was \"lucky\" to have experienced such tough environments, which taught him to work hard, he said.\n\nIn 1966, there was a military coup and then counter-coup in Nigeria - a time of upheaval for army officers but Buhari always maintained he was too junior to have played any significant role.\n\nLess than 10 years later, under a military government, Buhari had risen to become military governor of the north-east, an area then comprising six states.\n\nAfter less than a year, Buhari, now in his mid-30s, was promoted again, becoming federal commissioner for petroleum and natural resources (in effect oil minister) in 1976 under Olusegun Obasanjo in his first spell as Nigerian head of state.\n\nBy 1978, Buhari, then a colonel, had returned to being a military commander. His tough stance in 1983 - when some Nigerian islands were annexed in Lake Chad by Chadian soldiers - is still remembered in the north-east, after he blockaded the area and drove off the invaders.\n\nThe end of 1983 saw another coup, against elected President Shehu Shagari, and Buhari, now a major-general, became the country\'s military ruler. By his own account, he was not one of the plotters but was installed (and subsequently discarded) by those who held the real power and needed a figurehead.\n\nOther accounts suggest he played a more active role in removing Shagari than he was willing to admit.\n\nBuhari ruled for 20 months, a period remembered for a campaign against indiscipline and corruption, as well as for human rights abuses.\n\nAbout 500 politicians, officials and businessmen were jailed as part of a campaign against waste and corruption.\n\nSome saw this as the heavy-handed repression of military rule. Others remember it as a praiseworthy attempt to fight the endemic corruption that was holding back Nigeria\'s development.\n\nBuhari retained a rare reputation for honesty among Nigeria\'s politicians, both military and civilian, largely because of this campaign.\n\nAs part of his \"war against indiscipline\", he ordered Nigerians to form neat queues at bus stops, under the sharp eyes of whip-wielding soldiers. Civil servants who were late for work were publicly humiliated by being forced to do frog jumps.\n\nSome of his measures might have been seen as merely eccentric. But others were genuinely repressive, such as a decree to restrict press freedom, under which journalists were jailed.\n\nBuhari\'s government also locked up Nigeria\'s greatest musical hero, Fela Kuti - a thorn in the side of successive leaders - on trumped-up charges relating to currency exports.\n\nBuhari\'s attempts to re-balance the public finances by curbing imports led to many job losses and the closure of businesses.\n\nAs part of anti-corruption measures, he also ordered that the currency be replaced - the colour of the naira notes was changed - forcing all holders of old notes to exchange them at banks within a limited period.\n\nPrices rose while living standards fell, and in August 1985 Buhari was ousted and imprisoned for 40 months. Army chief Gen Ibrahim Babangida took over.\n\nAfter his release and, he said, having seen the consequences of the break-up of the Soviet Union, Buhari decided to enter party politics, now convinced of the virtues of multiparty democracy and free and fair elections.\n\nDespite this, Buhari always defended the 1983 coup, saying in 2005: \"The military came in when it was absolutely necessary and the elected people had failed the country.\"\n\nHe also rejected accusations that his measures against journalists and others had gone too far, insisting that he had been merely applying the laws that others had been breaking.\n\nHe was elected president in 2015, becoming the first opposition candidate to defeat an incumbent since the return of multiparty democracy in 1999.\n\nAs president, Buhari made a virtue of his \"incorruptibility\", declaring his relatively modest wealth and saying he had \"spurned several past opportunities\" to enrich himself.\n\nHe was plain spoken by nature, which sometimes played well for him in the media and sometimes badly.\n\nAlthough few doubted his personal commitment to fighting corruption and there were several notable scalps, some questioned whether the structures enabling mismanagement had really been reformed.\n\nAnd attempts to improve youth employment prospects were, at best, a work in progress.\n\nOn the day Buhari left office, some Nigerians were asked in a video that was widely shared on social media, what they would remember most about his time in office, and all respondents said the same thing: \'Bag of rice\'.\n\nThe reason was simple - rice is the staple food in the country.\n\nA standard 50kg (110lb) bag of rice, which could help feed a household of between eight and 10 for about a month, cost just 7,500 naira ($5; £3) under President Goodluck Jonathan, who was defeated by Buhari in 2015, but went up to 60,000 naira a few years afterwards.\n\nThis led to hunger in many parts of the country.\n\nThe huge surge in the price of rice was because, in an echo of his earlier policy as a military ruler, Buhari banned the importation of rice to encourage more Nigerian farmers to grow the crop.\n\nHowever, local producers were unable to meet the high demand and many of his supporters lost their faith in him.\n\nIsmail Danyaro, a resident of the northern city of Kano, said he had backed Buhari since he first contested the presidency in 2003.\n\n\"I used to buy a 50kg bag of rice under Goodluck [Jonathan] but when Buhari came, I found it difficult to buy even a 25kg bag of rice because it became so expensive,\" he told the BBC.\n\nNigerians love nicknames and some of the country\'s leaders\' nicknames have stuck even long after they left office.\n\nFor example, former military leader Ibrahim Badamasi Babangida is still called \"Maradona\" for what people perceived as his tactical dribbles on issues and situations.\n\nFor Buhari, it was \"Baba [Father] go slow\" after it took him six months to name his first cabinet on assuming office in 2015.\n\nResponding to his nickname years later, Buhari said it wasn\'t his fault that it took so long to get anything done.\n\n\"Yes, we are slow because the system is slow. It\'s not Baba that is slow but it is the system so I am going by this system and I hope we will make it,\" he said in 2018.\n\nNigerian politics in 2022-2023 remains one of the most interesting in the country\'s democratic history.\n\nIn the minds of many, it was the first time that a sitting president wasn\'t really bothered about who his successor was going to be.\n\nOpenly, Buhari declared he would support whoever won his party\'s (All Progressives Congress) nomination but insiders say behind the scenes he was ambivalent.\n\nBuhari\'s body language emboldened all five candidates seeking the APC\'s endorsement and their supporters all went around saying they had his backing.\n\nAt one point it felt as if Buhari opposed the candidacy of his eventual successor, Bola Tinubu.\n\nWhat followed was the declaration of the \"naira swap policy\" which the Buhari administration announced would, among other things, limit the influence of money in the 2023 elections.\n\nMany Nigerians believed that the policy was targeted at preventing Tinubu from becoming president even though he had been chosen as the APC candidate.\n\nThe policy involved the confiscation of trillions of old naira notes and their replacement with new notes for the highest denominations.\n\nHowever, there were not enough new notes, leading to shortages and suffering by millions, particularly the less well-off, who rely on cash for their daily transactions.\n\nThe policy was only suspended after a Supreme Court ruling, just days before the election.\n\nTinubu won narrowly, with 37% of votes cast, as the opposition was divided.\n\nAny assessment of Buhari\'s presidency must take account his declining health, which caused him to take significant absences from work, especially during his first term.\n\nThe former military ruler may have reinvented himself as a democrat but there was no such commitment to transparency concerning his own health, with Nigerians left uninformed about the fitness of their head of state for office.\n\nMuhammadu Buhari married twice, first to Safinatu Yusuf from 1971-1988, and then in 1989 to Aisha Halilu, who survives him.

He said providing rent supplements for existing market housing is part of the plan.\n\n\"Rent supplement units are new units,\" Nixon said.\n\n\"Taking a unit on, that would be in the open market, and creating a rent supplement for that unit creates an affordable unit that would not have been affordable before this.\"\n\nThe annual report said an additional 1,626 units were under construction as of March 31.\n\nOn Friday, Nixon and Eleanor Olszewski, the federal minister of emergency management and community resilience and MP for Edmonton Centre, announced that the federal and provincial governments will spend $203 million combined to build 2,300 affordable housing units across Alberta.\n\nThe provincial government has spent $386 million through its Affordable Housing Partnership Program since 2022, and plans to spend another $655 million over the next three years.\n\nWhitzman, the U of T researcher, sees problems with Alberta\'s use of subsidies to help make market housing more affordable. The payments, she said, don\'t always make up the difference between the rent charged for a unit and what a lower-income tenant can afford.\n\nRent subsidies also keep tenants in the private market, which may not provide the same kind of rent stability as a unit in a community-housing or non-market unit., she said.\n\nNixon rejects calls for Alberta to implement rent control while the province builds out its affordable housing supply. He argues rent caps provide a disincentive to developers who build new apartment and homes.\n\nWhitzman said that isn\'t the case in jurisdictions like Quebec, which has rent control.\n\nNo provincial government is doing a great job building affordable housing, Whitzman said, but Alberta is failing on several fronts.\n\nShe said Alberta has a growing rate of evictions, and that the government needs to improve benefits so people can afford to live.\n\nThe Alberta government can also change the building code and provide guidance to municipalities on how they can change zoning bylaws to allow more apartment buildings, she said.\n\nCalgary, and particularly Edmonton, are doing well with zoning changes, but only because they did so on their own, Whitzman added.\n\nOpposition NDP housing critic Janis Irwin, the MLA for Edmonton-Highlands-Norwood, said she isn\'t surprised the government fell short of its affordable-housing goals.\n\nNixon often cites increases in market housing starts as proof Alberta is building more housing, which in turn will make more apartments available as tenants move into new homes.\n\nBut Irwin argues the UCP government needs to spend more on new non-market housing, and reiterated a call to institute a rent cap.\n\nShe said Nixon could spend more on new affordable housing builds, noting the government ended the 2024-25 year with a $8.2 billion surplus.\n\n\"They could be using that money to invest in new affordable housing. They could be upgrading the affordable housing that we know is in disrepair,\" Irwin said.\n\n\"We know that investments in housing will will pay dividends down the road. These should be viewed as investments and not expenses.\"', 'https://i.cbc.ca/1.7583557.1752274465!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_1180/jason-nixon-williams-hall.jpg?im=Resize%3D620', 'https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/edmonton/alberta-gov-t-fell-short-of-its-affordable-housing-goal-last-year-annual-report-1.7583553', 'CBC News', NULL, 'dmoz/Business/Real Estate/Residential, dmoz/Home/Homeowners, dmoz/Home/Home Improvement/Restoration, dmoz/Society/Issues/Housing, dmoz/Home/Apartment Living, news/Politics', '2025-07-14 07:00:00', '2025-07-14 07:04:24', '2025-07-14 07:04:24');

(\"Galiano\" or the \"Company\") ( TSX: GAU) (NYSE American: GAU) today announced pos', 'Figure 1: Abore plan map showing current drilling locations and highlighted intercepts (CNW Group/Galiano Gold Inc.)\n\nVANCOUVER, BC , July 14, 2025 /CNW/ - Galiano Gold Inc. (\"Galiano\" or the \"Company\") ( TSX: GAU) (NYSE American: GAU) today announced positive results from a deep step-out drilling program at the Abore deposit, with mineralization intercepted in all four holes across a 1,200 meters (\"m\") strike length. This drilling campaign reinforces Abore\'s expansion potential at depth and provides a foundation for future deep drilling programs to further test for mineralization below the boundaries of the current Mineral Reserve and Mineral Resource. Abore is a cornerstone deposit at the Asanko Gold Mine (\"AGM\"), located in Ghana , West Africa , and is currently being mined by the Company.\n\nAbore Deep Drilling Results\n\nThe completed Abore deep step-out drilling program consisted of four holes totalling 1,907m and was designed to test for continuity of mineralization significantly below the current Abore Mineral Reserve and Mineral Resource and to demonstrate the blue-sky potential for future Mineral Resource and Mineral Reserve expansion. The program confirmed the Abore granite and mineralizing system continues 200m below the current Mineral Reserve pit shell over a strike length of at least 1,200m and remains open in all directions. Notably, the system appears to carry grades and widths at these depths sufficient to support the potential development of bulk underground mining.\n\nHighlights of intercepts from the Abore deep drilling program include (all diamond core samples):\n\nHole ABDD25-350: 36m @ 2.5 grams per tonne (\"g/t\") gold (\"Au\") from 370m including 22m @ 3.8 g/t Au Hole ABDD25-352: 18m @ 1.9 g/t Au from 415m and 12m @ 1.5 g/t Au from 439m Hole ABPC25-356: 16m @ 3.1 g/t Au from 412m and 5m @ 2.3 g/t Au from 433m \"Intersecting mineralized granite in all four deep holes of this program is an important step in advancing our understanding of the blue-sky underground expansion potential at Abore,\" stated Matt Badylak , Galiano\'s President and CEO. \"These results continue to build on the success from our previous drilling campaigns and confirm that the controlling structures and host lithologies that characterize the Abore mineralizing system are present and fertile well below any areas previously drilled to date.\"\n\nAbore Infill Drilling Phase 2 Program\n\nFollowing the positive results of a Phase 1 drilling program reported in Q1 2025, which targeted mineralization within and directly below the Mineral Reserve pit (see press release \"Galiano Gold Announces Discovery of New High-Grade Zone at Abore with Intercept of 50m @ 3.2 g/t Au & Results of Infill Drilling Program \" dated May 5, 2025 ), the Company is pleased to announce that a Phase 2 infill drilling program has commenced at Abore. This infill program will continue to test for further extensions of mineralization immediately below the boundaries of Abore\'s Mineral Reserve and Mineral Resource.\n\nBackground\n\nAbore is located approximately 13 kilometers north of the AGM\'s processing plant, directly along the haul road, and has current Measured and Indicated Mineral Resources of 638,000 ounces at 1.24 g/t Au and Inferred Mineral Resources of 78,000 ounces at 1.17 g/t Au, as published in the Company\'s most recent Mineral Reserve and Mineral Resource estimates effective December 31, 2024 (see press release \"Galiano Gold Announces 2025 Guidance And Provides Mineral Reserve And Mineral Resource Update \" dated January 28, 2025 ).\n\nThe Abore deposit sits along the Esaase shear corridor, which also hosts the Esaase deposit, and forms part of the northeast striking Asankrangwa gold belt. The geology of Abore is characterized by a sedimentary sequence composed primarily of siltstones, shales and thickly bedded sandstones that has been intruded by a granite, which lies parallel to the shear and dipping steeply to the northwest. The majority of mineralization is constrained to the granite, hosted in west dipping quartz vein areas developed primarily along the eastern margin of the granite/sediment contact.\n\n1. Intervals reported are hole lengths with true width estimated to be 80%-90%\n\n2. Intervals are not top cut and are calculated with the assumptions of > 0.5 g/t and < 3m of internal waste. Qualified Person and QA/QC Chris Pettman , P. Geo, Vice President Exploration of Galiano, is a Qualified Person as defined by National Instrument 43-101, Standards of Disclosure for Mineral Projects , and has supervised the preparation of the scientific and technical information that forms the basis for this news release. Mr. Pettman is responsible for all aspects of the work, including the Data Verification and Quality Control/Quality Assurance programs and has verified the data disclosed, by reviewing all data and supervising its compilation. There are no known factors that could materially affect the reliability of data collected and verified under his supervision. No quality assurance/quality control issues have been identified to date. Mr. Pettman is not independent of Galiano. Certified Reference Materials and Blanks are inserted by Galiano into the sample stream at the rate of 1:14 samples. Field duplicates are collected at the rate of 1:30 samples. All samples have been analyzed by Intertek Minerals Ltd. (\"Intertek\") in Tarkwa, Ghana with standard preparation methods. A combination of fire assay with atomic absorption finish and photon analyses were undertaken. Photon assays used 500g samples and fire assays used 50g samples. ChrysosTM Photon assay uses high energy X-ray to activate gold nuclei in a large sample ca. 500g. Photon assay uses a larger sample, thus the variance on the sampling error is less. Crushing the sample to 2-3mm is required in many cases. Photon assay tends to have a higher detection limit than fire assay (0.02ppm). Intertek does its own introduction of QA/QC samples into the sample stream and reports them to Galiano for double checking. Higher grade samples are re-analysed from pulp or reject material or both. Intertek is an international company operating in 100 countries and is independent of Galiano. It provides testing for a wide range of industries including the mining, metals, and oil sectors.

(\"Valour \"), and its corporate Bitcoin treasury.\n\nAs of July 13, 2025 , Valour has achieved an all-time high of US$302,000,170 (C$413,530,342) in Assets Under Management (\"AUM\" ) for its Bitcoin exchange-traded products (\"ETPs\" ), reflecting strong market momentum and continued investor inflows.\n\nIn parallel, DeFi Technologies\' corporate treasury holdings of 208.8 Bitcoin also reached an all-time high valuation of approximately US$25.6 million (C$35 million ) on July 13, 2025 , when Bitcoin reached an all-time high of US$122,625 .\n\n\"These record-breaking figures reinforce the strength of our vertically integrated model and the value we\'re delivering to shareholders through operating efficiency and smart capital allocation,\" said Olivier Roussy Newton , CEO of DeFi Technologies. \"We\'re not just holding Bitcoin -- we\'re monetizing it across our asset management and trading infrastructure.\"\n\nA Profitable Bitcoin Treasury Company with Real Revenue\n\nDeFi Technologies is one of the few publicly traded Bitcoin treasury companies with an underlying operating business. The Company\'s Bitcoin holdings have been purchased entirely through free cash flow from operating revenue, rather than debt or equity dilution.

Core is a Bitcoin -powered, EVM-compatible Layer 1 blockchain that brings Bitcoin finance to life, powering both the first-ever non-custodial BTC staking protocol.\n\nDigital Asset Treasury\n\nAs part of its vertically integrated model, DeFi Technologies actively manages a diversified digital asset treasury designed to support long-term capital appreciation, strategic flexibility, and balance sheet strength. These holdings complement the Company\'s core operating businesses -- including asset management, staking, and trading -- and are acquired using free cash flow generated by the Company, without the need for dilution or leverage.\n\nAs of June 30, 2025 , DeFi Technologies\' digital asset treasury was valued at approximately US$48.4 million (C$66 million ). The portfolio includes direct exposure to Bitcoin , Ethereum , Solana , and other high-conviction tokens aligned with the Company\'s long-term outlook on digital infrastructure. In addition, the Company holds approximately US$14 million (C$19 million ) in cash and USDT, providing strategic flexibility to expand or rebalance its treasury as market conditions evolve.\n\n4,913,918 SUI : US$14,272,777 (C$19,582,250) This robust treasury strategy not only strengthens the Company\'s financial foundation but also enhances its ability to capitalize on future growth opportunities and aligns with its goal of building long-term shareholder value.\n\nAbout DeFi Technologies\n\nDeFi Technologies Inc.

He entered the U.S. Capitol with his wife, Jeanette Mangia, where the couple was seen inside Speaker Nancy Pelosi\'s office and the Senate Chamber. Prosecutors say they rifled through documents and took photos, including one of Mangia sitting in former U.S. Sen. Pat Toomey\'s chair.\n\nWhen Capitol Police tried to remove them, Pastucci shoved an officer, and Mangia kicked another in the groin. The pair briefly exited the building but reentered through the Rotunda and joined a crowd pushing against police, according to the FBI.\n\nThe couple was arrested on April 27, 2023, after authorities received an anonymous tip. Pastucci was convicted on all 11 federal charges in a bench trial, but a judge later vacated 10 of them following a Department of Justice motion. In December 2024, he was sentenced on the remaining felony. The following month, President Donald J. Trump issued a sweeping pardon to all individuals charged or convicted in connection with the Capitol riot, which included Pastucci.\n\nMangia\'s charges were dismissed without prejudice on Jan. 22, 2025. In her opinion, U.S. District Judge Beryl A. Howell condemned the presidential proclamation that labeled the prosecutions a \"national injustice,\" writing: \"That merely raises the dangerous specter of future lawless conduct by other sore losers and undermines the rule of law.\" Despite the court\'s strong language, the judge acknowledged that the prosecution had the authority to drop the case and ordered the dismissal .\n\nWhile Pastucci\'s federal charges were being resolved, he was also facing six charges in York County -- including rape, aggravated indecent assault, sexual assault, stalking, indecent assault, and false imprisonment -- stemming from a July 1, 2023, domestic incident in Fairview Township.\n\nThe woman who made the allegations told police that Pastucci raped her in his home and wouldn\'t allow her to leave. She said he had become increasingly controlling, frequently accused her of infidelity, and allegedly placed a tracking device on her car to monitor her movements. Pastucci told police the sex was consensual and claimed he took her car keys to prevent her from driving drunk.\n\nOn July 7, 2025, the York County District Attorney\'s Office filed a motion to nolle prosse all charges, stating that their office had been unable to reach the victim despite months of attempts. \"Without the victim\'s cooperation, the commonwealth cannot prove these charges beyond a reasonable doubt,\" Chief Deputy District Attorney Rachel Sherman wrote in the filing, as reported by PennLive.\n\nA victim/witness coordinator reportedly sent a final text to the woman warning that the case would be dropped if they didn\'t hear back. She did not respond. Judge Amber Kraft granted the motion the same day, officially closing the case.\n\nDaily Voice has reached out to the York County District Attorney\'s Office, Pastucci, and the court for comment but has not yet received a response.\n\nCharges dropped under nolle prosequi may still be refiled at a later date.

The left wing came down, the ring wing came up. I thought \'He\'s keen to go left as soon as he takes off.\'\n\n\'He\'s banking hard left and then the next thing you know, it\'s like another handbrake turn. He went left so violently and I thought \'What is he doing?\' He was only about 100 metres up by this point.\n\n\'And then he corkscrewed upside down into the floor, the plane was only in the air for seconds. I looked at it and the fireball went up, there was fire and smoke everywhere.

It was scheduled to return to Lelystad on Sunday night.\n\nThe airport announced on Sunday night it was closed until further notice, with all arriving and departing flights cancelled.

(302, 'When a marriage ends, advisors step up | Advisor.ca', 'One of the key decisions advisors can help their divorced clients make is what to do with their matrimonial home\n\nLike other tough life events, the end of a client\'s marriage is a complex, emotional transition that provides advisors with an opportunity to', 'One of the key decisions advisors can help their divorced clients make is what to do with their matrimonial home\n\nLike other tough life events, the end of a client\'s marriage is a complex, emotional transition that provides advisors with an opportunity to deliver real value and deepen one or both relationships. And one of the key decisions advisors must help their divorced clients make is what to do with their matrimonial home -- the property they live in at the time of separation.\n\nTreena Nault has guided multiple clients through the process. She is a certified financial planner with Nault Group Private Wealth, which operates under IG Wealth Management in Winnipeg.\n\n\"Financially, with the right advice and the right choices, their life doesn\'t have to be massively impacted,\" she said. \"I\'ve seen people move on and thrive in life, and meet the love of their life, or maybe the second love of their life, and live happily ever after.\"\n\nGive clients the time and space to express their feelings before going straight into numbers and planning next steps, Nault recommended.\n\n\"Really listen and take time to be there for them emotionally first,\" she said.\n\nSharing personal stories or client stories -- without identifying them -- is one way advisors can help clients make sense of their situation and what to do about the family finances, Nault suggested.\n\n\"This isn\'t something that happens in one meeting and it\'s one and done. It takes time to go through it,\" she said.\n\nAdvisors can also ask their clients if they\'re seeking counselling support and share stories of themselves or other clients speaking to a counsellor and how it helped them.\n\nAdvisors differ in their views on whether it\'s a best practice to continue serving both spouses after a divorce. It\'s a decision every advisor must make, and individual situations often dictate the right answer.\n\nNault believes it\'s tricky to protect the interests of both parties after a divorce. Typically, she talks to both partners about that and then recommends that she work with just one of them. \"Otherwise, it\'s a conflict of interest, in my opinion,\" she said.\n\nAfter hearing them out, advisors need to focus the client\'s attention on a new financial plan.\n\n\"I often say to clients, \'OK, look, I get that there\'s an emotional side to this, but my job is to bring the facts,\'\" Nault said. \"So, I obviously listen, I empathize, I allow that conversation to happen from an emotional perspective and then we get into the financial plan, which really gives us all the answers.\"\n\nAmong the most significant assets to be dealt with is the matrimonial home, which represents a powerful combination of financial and emotional value.\n\nClients will often speak rashly -- they don\'t want more change; they don\'t want to move the kids. Emotions tend to be especially heightened among those who didn\'t initiate the split.\n\nThe most common options include a spousal buyout, where one spouse buys their ex\'s share of the matrimonial home and takes sole ownership, or the divorced couple sells the home and each party walks away with half of the net proceeds, said Olivia D\'Ammizio, a family lawyer and associate with Shulman & Partners LLP in Toronto.\n\nCouples can also come to a temporary arrangement where the spouses co-own the home for a period of time or rent out the home and share profits or costs while waiting for a better time to sell. Alternatively, one spouse could keep the home while the other gets a larger share of other assets to balance the home\'s value.\n\n\"Some separations take a year, some take three years,\" Nault said. \"I\'ve seen people co-own a home or own a home for another person for their lifetime. There\'s no cookie-cutter approach.\"\n\nIn some parts of the country, home ownership is out of reach for many single Canadians. D\'Ammizio said she sees a lot of divorced couples selling their homes and splitting the proceeds as soon as they can because \"people are just finding it unaffordable to pay rent for a new place, as well as the carrying costs for the matrimonial home.\"\n\nMany will list the home for sale -- which can take months, given the softness in the current residential real estate market.\n\n\"A lot of my clients, when they\'re in these situations, they\'re saying either they\'re staying in the home until it\'s sold or until it\'s dealt with, or we need to list it as soon as possible so they can get whatever funds are owed to them, so that they can move on,\" she added.\n\nAdvisors should ask clients what they\'ve discussed with their ex and whether they have it in writing. Also, ask if there\'s one person who\'s really attached to the home and wants to keep it, Nault suggested.\n\nThey should also remind their clients that even if they do end up selling the home and splitting the proceeds, they may not be able to qualify for a new home mortgage on a single income. In these cases, advisors could refer a client to a mortgage specialist to help outline their options.\n\n\"It\'s very hard, because if somebody\'s in ... a million-dollar house, but now they can afford to buy a $500,000 house, that\'s a big difference in possibly neighbourhood, obviously square footage, all of that stuff,\" Nault said. \"And one of the first things I\'ll say to a client when they\'re going through a separation is, \'This is a very large impact in your financial plan to go from two incomes to one income, so I just want you to expect that things are going to change a little.\'\"\n\nFor a spousal buyout, the divorced couple must first determine the value of the home.\n\n\"The best evidence is always an appraisal of the home,\" rather than relying on online estimates, D\'Ammizio said. If a couple cannot agree on a buyout price based on one appraisal, she recommended using the average of two appraisals or a third appraisal if its value is between the first two appraisals. Another option is to get a letter of opinion from a real estate agent.\n\nBased on the agreed-upon home price, advisors can then calculate the net equity of the matrimonial home.\n\nWhen that\'s all done, advisors should walk their clients through several considerations such as how they\'ll come up with the money to buy out their ex; if they\'ll buy out the home through a lump-sum payment, a new mortgage or a combination of both; what their cash flow would be if they opted for a buyout; and how the buyout would impact their other plans such as funding their children\'s education or their retirement.\n\n\"Take the time, understand what their priorities are. Maybe for some people, they would say, \'You know what, in order to keep my children in this house, I\'m willing to put off my retirement by 10 years, or five or whatever,\'\" Nault said.\n\n\"And so, I think it is numbers, but it\'s also very personal to each situation.\"\n\nUltimately, Nault said advisors may want to consult their client\'s lawyer and understand what\'s in their separation agreement to ensure everyone is on the same page throughout the decision-making process.\n\n\"You have to kind of know what\'s being discussed with the lawyer. Possibly there\'s a meeting with the financial advisor and the client and the lawyer to get more information out there and to walk through some of the scenarios,\" she said.\n\nAdvisors who successfully support a smooth transition for their clients are likely to reap benefits too, Nault said. You\'re helping with a complex set of issues when it\'s needed most -- that won\'t be forgotten.\n\n\"You want to explore all the angles with the client and get them through it, and then they will be thankful to you, and they will be loyal to you, and you\'ll get great referrals from people you\'ve helped through such a large life event.\"', 'https://www.advisor.ca/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/1600x1114-divorce-unfiltered-AdobeStock-LIGHTFIELD-STUDIOS-293647295.jpeg', 'https://www.advisor.ca/practice/planning-and-advice/when-a-marriage-ends-advisors-step-up/', 'Advisor\'s Edge', NULL, 'dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out, dmoz/Society/Advice, dmoz/Recreation/Pets/Free Services, news/Business', '2025-07-14 07:00:00', '2025-07-14 07:04:24', '2025-07-14 07:04:24'),

Tania Thorne, KPBS News\n\nMARIJUANA HAS BEEN ON A PROHIBITION ROLLER COASTER FOR A LONG TIME. BUT IN THE PAST 20 YEARS, IT HAS BEEN LEGALIZED FOR MEDICINAL AND RECREATIONAL USE. SCI-TECH REPORTER THOMAS FUDGE SPOKE TO GENETIC SCIENTISTS TRYING TO UNLOCK THE SECRETS OF CANNABIS.\n\nThe cannabis plant, a native to Asia, has been used for millenia as a mind altering drug and a medicine for many ailments. Prohibition in the U.S. forced it underground but never prevented its cultivation or hybridization. At San Diego\'s Salk Institute, professor Todd Michael genetically sequenced 193 strains of Cannabis to understand just what it\'s capable of.\n\n\"We have this very important crop that people have been using for thousands of years and people know very little about it. Turns out what we discovered is the plant has a massive amount of potential that we have really just started to understand and really build the tools to try to tap into.\"\n\nMichael says he\'s sequenced thousands of plants and cannabis is the most interesting and various. And he wants to understand the plant\'s many dways of making cannabinoids. Those are the chemical compounds that can alter our mind and body.\n\nThe best known is THC, which makes you high. But there are many more cannabinoids, created by a common molecular pathway. What Michael calls the end product... requires a lot of acronyms to describe.\n\nAll these cannabinoids that we want. We can actually manipulate this pathway and make many different types of cannabinoids which we now call minor cannabinoids.\"\n\nThose cannabinoids, which are not psychoactive, interact with a set of human receptors, called the endo-cannabinoid system. Some minor cannabinoids have proven to be pretty powerful. CBD can control epileptic seizures. Anecdotal evidence shows it helps treat anxiety and chronic pain.\n\nUC San Diego recently studied whether CBD could reduce disruptive behavior in boys with severe autism. Igor Grant, director of UCSD\'s Center for Medicinal Cannabis Research, said the results of the study were not definitive, but they were encouraging.\n\n\"About two thirds of the kids who got CBD were rated as improved overall by the clinicians, and only a third that got placebo were seen as improved overall.\"\n\nThe search for effective health-enhancing cannabinoids has taken root in the private actor. Phylos Bioscience, based in Oregon, breeds many varieties of cannabis that can be grown from seed.\n\nAlisha Holloway is the chief scientific officer at Phylos. She says one cannabinoid with a pretty good story is THC-V. That\'s THC minus a couple of carbon atoms. It\'s been called diet weed because it gives you kinda the opposite of the munchies. Holloway says Phylos did a clinical trial that did show THC-V was energizing and reduced the appetite. So they bred a plant with plenty of it.\n\n\"And worked on identifying genetic markers that could help us select for plants with higher levels of THC-V. And we developed those plants that now have 20 percent THC-V.\"\n\nThere is a lot of excitement around cannabis these days. Hemp production is legal again, thanks to changes to the US Farm Bill.\n\nIgor Grant, at UCSD, wonders if cannabis deserves all the attention. He says many plants have molecules that could interact well in humans. Maybe we\'ve discovered them in pot because its psychoactive effects have captured our attention.\n\n\"And we as humans, throughout recorded history have sought to change how we feel. Right? And so cannabis is one way to do that. Alcohol is another way to do that. Opioids are yet another way.\"\n\nPlant geneticist Todd Michael disagrees. He says the relationship between cannabis and cannabinoid receptors in the brain and the body make this plant different.\n\n\"I would say that it\'s more than just that we like to get high. I would say there\'s this very intimate relationship between this plant that makes something that invades not only our consciousness but our well-being.\"\n\nMichael says cannabis is also easy to grow, producing high yields with minimal treatment. That means it\'s good for producing other things like hemp fiber or cooking oil.

Sanjay Malhotra said at the time.\n\nThe central bank lowered its inflation forecast for the fiscal year to 3.7% from 4.0%.\n\nMany economists have penciled in at least one more rate cut this year if inflation remains capped, though they said the bar could be relatively high.\n\nCapital Economics noted that the RBI\'s shift from an accommodative stance to a neutral one in June\'s meeting significantly raises the threshold for further policy easing.', 'https://images.contentstack.io/v3/assets/blt4eb669caa7dc65b2/blta7dd42ebdd7b93b8/61899b34a3c7df383578294c/morningstar-og.png', 'https://www.morningstar.com/news/dow-jones/202507142505/indias-inflation-cools-to-more-than-six-year-low', 'Morningstar', NULL, 'dmoz/Society/Issues/Economic, dmoz/Business/Investing/Day Trading, dmoz/Home/Personal Finance/Investing, news/Business', '2025-07-14 07:02:41', '2025-07-14 07:04:25', '2025-07-14 07:04:25'),

The findin', 'Researchers at MUSC Hollings Cancer Center have identified a signaling loop involved in the growth and persistence of leukemia cells - and developed a novel immunotherapy that can disrupt that loop to boost immune function and improve survival. The findings, published in Nature Communications, offer new hope for treating and preventing cancer.\n\nHollings researcher Sophie Paczesny, M.D., Ph.D., co-leader of the Cancer Biology and Immunology Research Program, led the multidisciplinary research team. Paczesny, a pediatric hematologist-oncologist and bone marrow transplant expert, has spent her career fighting one of the most difficult-to-treat blood cancers: acute myeloid leukemia (AML).\n\n\"I\'ve seen too many patients - especially children - suffer from AML,\" Paczesny said. \"Unlike other forms of leukemia that respond well to chemotherapy or CAR-T cell therapy, AML has proven much more stubborn.\"\n\nA challenging diagnosis\n\nAML is a fast-growing and aggressive form of blood cancer. Even with treatment, the cancer often comes back. This high rate of relapse can be traced to leukemia stem cells, a small group of cells that can survive chemotherapy by hiding in the bone marrow. These \"hidden\" cells then send out signals that both help the cancer grow and prevent the immune system from fighting back.\n\nThe new study revealed a key pathway used by these leukemia cells: the loop between a protein called IL-33 and its receptor IL1RL1.\n\n\"The more aggressive the leukemia, the more IL1RL1 we saw,\" Paczesny said. \"And, in AML, it forms a damaging feedback loop. The leukemia starts and keeps growing because of stress that triggers a self-sustaining loop between IL-33 and its receptor, which also creates an immune environment that helps the cancer avoid being attacked.\"\n\nBreaking the loop\n\nTo break the feedback loop, the researchers developed a novel immunotherapy using a lab-made antibody. Known as a bispecific antibody, the treatment worked via dual means:\n\nIt blocked the IL-33/IL1RL1 signal by targeting and killing leukemia cells carrying IL1RL1. It prompted the immune system to attack the cancer cells by activating infection-fighting T-cells like CD8+.\n\n\"These leukemia cells have learned to create a protective environment that helps them grow and avoid treatment,\" Paczesny said. \"We developed a bispecific antibody that can break through that environment and target the cells directly.\"\n\nIn lab and mouse models, this dual-targeting approach not only destroyed the cancer cells but also removed their protective immune bubbles, making it easier for the body to fight back. The antibody slowed or stopped leukemia cell growth, limited immune suppression and reduced relapse rates. Even in tough cases where leukemia had already taken hold, the new therapy improved survival. And it did so without causing major side effects.\n\nA new way forward\n\nThis study showed that targeting the signaling pathway used by leukemia stem cells can lead to better care for cancer patients. The researchers created an immunotherapy that not only killed cancer cells but also disrupted the immune system\'s ability to protect them. By blocking a hidden cancer signal, that therapeutic may one day stop leukemia in its tracks.\n\nThe promising results offer an approach that could improve treatments for AML as well as other cancers with a similar tumor microenvironment.\n\n\"IL1RL1 is expressed in other cancers too: colorectal, lung, ovarian, even brain cancers,\" Paczesny said. \"This could be a game-changer for many difficult-to-treat cancers.\"\n\nThe researchers also see the new antibody as overcoming some of the challenges of existing treatments. For instance, its low toxicity could make it safer to use and more acceptable to patients. It is also easier and less expensive to produce.\n\n\"Chemotherapy is toxic, and bone marrow transplants can come with serious risks. With immunotherapies like CAR-T cells, you need a customized treatment for each patient, which is expensive and time-consuming,\" Paczesny explained. \"Our treatment is an off-the-shelf drug. And it targets cells just enough to fight cancer without destroying the whole system. This could mean less time in the hospital, fewer side effects and a better quality of life.\"\n\nMore work is needed before the antibody can be used with patients, but this study is a major step forward. It could eventually lead to new treatments that target cancer cells at their roots and offer an option when standard treatments fail. The researchers are already working on next steps and are hopeful that Phase I clinical trials are on the horizon.\n\nFu, D., Jiang, H., Long, A. et al.

On its return trajectory, it takes the shape of a whirlpool attached to a small trail. Dubbed \"strudel\" by Emmerich, this vortex effect was unique to this 1994 film, as every franchise title that came after (especially the 10-season Syfy series \"Stargate SG-1\") opted for a slightly different visual effect to portray the same energy vortex.\n\nIf you\'ve seen \"SG-1\", you might remember the enduring image of a massive burst of energy rushing through the Stargate right before it\'s ready for intergalactic travel, taking on the appearance of a high-pressure water fountain. Samantha Carter (Amanda Tapping) playfully refers to this unstable vortex as Kawoosh, as it forms as soon as the Stargate gears up, rushing through the rings and devouring anything in its path before subsiding back to its source.\n\nThe science behind the formation of this unstable vortex can get a bit tricky, but it can be best understood as a safety measure that facilitates stable travel after it dissipates back into the pool. Later on, we learn that the Tok\'ra carry out their funeral customs by dissolving the dead in the path of the vortex, as its high-pressure velocity disintegrates anything it touches. As the episodes progress, we are privy to how this phenomenon is perceived by different factions, such as when those trapped in a prison planet (mistakenly) believed that this vortex could be used to travel backwards through a Stargate device. Other versions of this unstable vortex are seen in the Ori-made Supergate, which creates an even greater, more intense whirlpool due to the immense amount of energy it uses to propel itself forward.\n\nBut how was this Kawoosh effect created without the use of CGI? As you can already guess, the process was more complicated than it seems, as confirmed by \"The Making of Stargate,\" a 1994 documentary that explains how this practical visual effect was first created in Emmerich\'s \"Stargate.\"', 'https://www.slashfilm.com/img/gallery/how-stargates-team-practically-created-the-unstable-vortex-effect/l-intro-1751917974.jpg', 'https://www.slashfilm.com/1905984/how-stargate-created-unstable-vortex-effects-kawoosh/', 'Slashfilm', NULL, 'dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Useless Pages, dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out, dmoz/Home/Home Improvement/Energy Efficiency, dmoz/Science/Physics/Classical Mechanics, dmoz/Science/Anomalies and Alternative Science/Orgone Energy, news/Arts and Entertainment', '2025-07-14 07:00:00', '2025-07-14 07:04:25', '2025-07-14 07:04:25'),

Using 2022 ESRI Wayback satellite imagery, we manually digiti', 'Retrogressive thaw slumps (RTS) are thermokarst landforms resulting from the thawing of ice-rich permafrost in the pan-Arctic and high mountain regions, recognized as climate-related phenomena. Using 2022 ESRI Wayback satellite imagery, we manually digitized 900 RTS polygons on the Kanin Peninsula (NW Russia), categorizing them into 633 inactive and 267 active features based on morphology and vegetation patterns. The primary goal was not to create a complete RTS inventory but to develop a highly representative dataset for training machine learning models to automatically detect and classify RTS into active and inactive categories. This approach will facilitate regional-scale monitoring of permafrost degradation and enhance understanding of RTS impacts, including their effects on indigenous Nenets reindeer herders\' travel routes. By classifying RTS polygons into morphologically active and inactive features, this dataset aims to enable ongoing analysis of change patterns over time, offering critical insights in the current climate context.\n\nThe Kanin Peninsula is an important area for studying the pan-Arctic permafrost zone. The permafrost landscapes in this area are becoming more vulnerable to global warming, which is causing them to change quickly. Permafrost consists of subsurface materials that remain continuously frozen at or below 0 °C for a minimum of two consecutive years. Since the 1980s, rapidly rising temperatures have triggered widespread permafrost thaw and permanent degradation in many Arctic regions. The cryosphere, which includes sea ice, glaciers, lake and river ice, continental ice sheets, seasonal snow, permafrost, and seasonally frozen ground, spans 14% of the Earth\'s surface. The different cryospheric parameters interact and affect each other. However, sub-zero precipitations such as hail, frost, and freezing rain have shown a global decline in recent years. In Arctic regions, this reduction results in a thinner ground ice over permafrost soils, leaving them increasingly exposed to subaerial warming conditions. Along with extended periods of temperatures above 0 °C, this increased exposure of the ground surface to direct air influence instead of insulation by long-lying snow and ground ice-sheets is a key driving factor of permafrost degradation. Permanent thawing and removal of ice within permafrost soils leads to ground subsidence and the formation of different types of depressions known as thermokarst. If the soil-ice removal occurs at topographical steps, such as riverbanks or sea bluffs, smaller thermokarst features may, together with gravitational processes such as slumping and surface erosion, develop into larger self-activating processes such as RTS or thermo-erosion gullies (TEG).\n\nThermokarst processes poses a serious threat in the Arctic environments and the present climate context. Several examples of its detrimental impacts have been documented at different scales, affecting infrastructure, industrial sites, cultural heritage sites, ecosystems, and the mobility and life of indigenous people. The last is very relevant for the indigenous Nenets reindeer herders on Kanin Peninsula, where, along the annual migration routes, newly formed marshland, lakes, streams, and changes in the size of the existing water bodies poses new migration barriers that leads to: reduced access to already remote areas, fall-through-ice events, loss of grazing and calving habitats.\n\nPermafrost thawing and permanent degradation is also releasing large amounts of greenhouse gases into the atmosphere, such as carbon dioxide, methane - the second largest contributor to global warming after carbon dioxide, and nitrogen, contributing to global warming. One of the processes contributing largely to the abovementioned permafrost degradation is RTS activity and areal expansion. An RTS is a bowl-shaped landslide and landslide scar developed into ice-rich permafrost ground, which enlarges each summer as exposed ground-ice melts in the steep back-scarp left from last year slumps, and the headwall collapses. As warming occurs, the temperature of the ground-ice slowly increases closer to 0 degrees and the part of the soil column where the ice-loss and slumping may occur, becomes increasingly deep, whereas previously, colder ice would have held the soil particles together even during summer months.\n\nThe removal of intra-soil ice naturally results in reduced cohesion between soil particles, which also through reduced intra-particle friction caused by high pore-water content leads to the initiation of the geomorphic RTS-processes. The slumping of water-logged soil leaves a vertical or sloping scar and this exposes new frozen soil to thaw and subsequent new slumping. This cyclic process continues through the thawing season and only stops in the autumn with freezing-onset as air temperature drops under 0 degrees. During snow-season the resulting bowl-shape topography will normally catch more snow due to wind-drift, resulting in higher insulation and reduced penetration of the winter-cold in the RTS-scar. This means that when the snow disappears the covered ground has even higher temperatures than the non-RTS surroundings, and the renewal of the slumping process may commence even earlier that it would in a non-snow-covered position.\n\nThe precise feedback mechanisms involved in RTS activity on a landscape scale are still relatively poorly understood. This lack may be remedied by having rich inventories spread across various climatic and geographical zones. Nowadays, manually and automatically built inventories are both utilised. However, in order to automatically build inventories, a rich body of manually constructed inventories is needed to be able to calibrate automatic methods. Large parts of the Arctic, such as Canada, Alaska, Svalbard, and QTP have already consistent inventories (both manual and automatic) of RTS. Northern Russia represents the largest Arctic non-glaciated territory where RTS can initiate and develop. A few studies cover inventories of RTS for Russia, such as West Siberia (Yamal Peninsula, Urengoy region and Pechora delta), northeastern Siberia, Gydan Peninsula, Kolguev Island and Lena River, north Siberia (west Taymyr, east Taymyr, Lower Lena River, SW Verkhoyansk Mountain Range, Batagay mega slump, Chokurdakh, Iultinsky, Kolyuchinskaya, and Chukotka); and the latest datasets with full and partial coverage of RTS in the northern part of Russia.\n\nAlthough retrogressive thaw slumps (RTS) have not yet been documented on the Kanin Peninsula, our research addresses this gap by establishing the first comprehensive RTS inventory for the region. This work delivers critical insights into RTS distribution, the environmental variables influencing their development, and includes detailed morphological and spatial statistical analyses. Using up-to-date satellite imagery from 2022, we systematically identified and delineated RTS features. The resulting inventory holds significant value for a broad scientific audience as well as policymakers. For permafrost researchers, it serves as a base dataset to monitor permafrost degradation trends, analyse the spatial and temporal evolution of permafrost landscapes, and investigate the mechanisms behind RTS activation, evolution, and deactivation. Remote sensing experts can leverage this resource to refine predictive models, such as predicting future RTS dynamics under different climate change scenarios, simulate landscape evolution in permafrost regions, large-scale monitoring of permafrost landscapes and integration of ground-truth data with satellite imagery. For environmental scientists, to assess sediment loading in downstream ecosystems, to estimate carbon and greenhouse gas emissions from thawing permafrost, and to predict the impacts on river systems and water quality. For ecologists, to study habitat fragmentation and dynamics and to better understand the role of RTS in biodiversity changes. For policymakers, the inventory provides detailed and classified datasets enabling informed decisions about climate adaptation and mitigation planning, risk assessment in cold regions and improving the representation of permafrost feedbacks in climate models.\n\nKanin Peninsula is a large peninsula (approx. 18 000 km), located in the extreme northwestern Nenets Autonomous Okrug (NAO) surrounded by the White Sea to the west and the Barents Sea to the north and east (Fig. 1). It lies in the discontinuous permafrost zone. The peninsula is an elevated block of the Timan Ridge, where Precambrian sedimentary-metamorphic sequences and magmatic rocks, intruding them, form the Kanin Kamen Ridge - the middle part of the peninsula.\n\nThe bedrock topography is smoothened by Quaternary sediment overburden, reaching a thickness of at least 80 m. Palaeozoic and older successions on the peninsula are exposed in a gentle anticline. High-grade metamorphosed rocks occur near Cape Mikulkin (southeast extremity of the peninsula) and have a good exposure along the coasts towards the west and north. Three major bedrock units, the Mikulkinskaya, Tarkhanovskaya, and Tabuyevskaya groups compose the Neoproterozoic bedrock of the Kanin Peninsula. The Mikulkinskaya Group is exposed along the coast at Cape Mikulkin and has an estimated thickness of 1500 m. It is mainly composed of amphibolite facies metaturbidities, with a prominent formation of quartzites and calcsilicate rocks (skarnoids) in the upper part (Fig. 2). The contact with the overlaying Tarkhanovskaya Group is conformable. The ~5000 m thick sequence is metamorphosed to garnet-micaschists, which are exposed east of Cape Mikulkin and at the White Sea coast in the northwestern part of the peninsula. A tectonic contact was observed locally between the Tarkhanovskaya and overlying Tabuyevskaya groups. The 4000 m thick Tabuyevskaya Group is exposed along the Barents Sea coast of the peninsula and consists of various mica- and calcareous schists and volcano-sedimentary successions.\n\nThe northern part of Kanin appears as a plateau ridge. This upland has an average altitude of 150 m a.s.l. and is a direct continuation of the NW-SE Timan Ridge further to the southeast. Kanin is relatively flat, undulating, low-laying grassy tundra, with many small lakes and vast expenses of marshland, rivers, and streams that are deeply cut into the surface and not crossable during the summer months. On the north coast of the peninsula, which faces the open Barents Sea, high energy waves and thawing of permafrost causes rapid cliff retreat in unconsolidated glacio-tectonized sediments.\n\nThe southern part of the peninsula is called Kanin Neck. This area is especially narrow and is composed of low-lying lakes and marshland and thus is largely impassable by foot in the summer. This has an influence on human and animal migration patterns; during transmigrations, when herders travel with thousands of reindeer and loaded sleds, they can only cross in and out of Kanin Peninsula when the open water on Kanin Neck is frozen. This temperature-limited migration period creates an objective measure of the warming\'s effect on the timing of transmigration and on arrivals to the clinic to check their health. Kanin Kamen Ridge is a rocky elevation and is composed of crystalline schists, and its surface is covered with relatively coarse boulder loam or sand sediments. The maximum absolute altitude of this mountain ridge is 242 m a.s.l. Due to its elevated rugged relief, swampiness in this area is lower when compared to the more southern regions of the peninsula; however, large areas occupied by flat-mound swamps occur in depressions along the coast in the southern part and along the shores of large lakes.\n\nRivers in the study area belong to the Barents Sea basin and fluvial terraces are found along the rivers, due to the glacio-isostatic uplift history of the peninsula, like all previously glaciated arctic land masses. In their upper and middle reaches, these rivers are deeply incised due to the uplift; in some places, they form canyon like valleys with steep slopes and rocky channels. Small areas, occupied by slope and floodplain, form and tall-grass meadows, as well as juniper and willow shrub thickets. In their lower reaches, by the sea, rivers form wide estuaries that are drained during ebb tides. Marshes of different levels are in these estuaries. On the western side of the Kanin Peninsula are a few human settlements (villages such as Shoina, Chizha), which are connected with the mainland by regular aircraft traffic. By contrast, there is no permanent population or regular transport connections on the eastern part of the peninsula, washed by the Barents Sea.\n\nThe climate is subarctic, with the annual mean air temperature of -1.6 °C. The mean air temperature of February (the coldest month) is about -12.1 °C and of July (the warmest month) the mean is 9.7 °C. The vegetation is typical for the tundra zone. Sand dunes with typical adapted grassy vegetation occur along seashores, and inland areas affected by aeolian sand deposition in dunes. Marshes occur at river mouths and may be temporarily flooded by seawater at high tides.', 'https://media.springernature.com/m685/springer-static/image/art%3A10.1038%2Fs41597-025-05592-7/MediaObjects/41597_2025_5592_Fig1_HTML.png', 'https://www.nature.com/articles/s41597-025-05592-7', 'Nature', NULL, 'dmoz/Science/Environment/Climate Change, dmoz/Science/Earth Sciences/Paleogeography and Paleoclimatology, dmoz/Science/Earth Sciences/Quaternary Studies, news/Environment, news/Science', '2025-07-13 19:00:00', '2025-07-14 07:04:25', '2025-07-14 07:04:25'),

From football to basketball to baseball and everything in between, Scotty passionately covers the university he graduated from in 2022.\n\nThe Michigan Wolverines have a lot of momentum on the recruiting trail, and they are in a good spot to land more commitments in the coming weeks. Things have cooled a bit the past week, but there are some key targets set to announce their decisions soon, and Michigan is hoping for good news.\n\nA decision is also nearing for 2026 four-star linebacker Nick Abrams. He is announcing his decision on Wednesday, and he will pick between Michigan, Alabama, Georgia and Oregon.\n\nAfter seemingly being behind the other three schools in recent weeks, Michigan has made a surge in Abrams\' recruitment, per 247Sports\' Brian Dohn ($).\n\n\"Michigan made a push, and it included a substantial discussion about revenue sharing/NIL compensation that now has the Wolverines heavily in the mix, sources told 247Sports,\" Dohn wrote.\n\nNIL is a big factor in Abrams\' recruitment, which is a good sign for Michigan and is why the Wolverines are now firmly back in the running for arguably their top linebacker target left on the board.\n\n\"For me and my family, it is the true NIL; the name, image, likeness,\" Abrams said. \"It\'s branding, exposure. Revenue sharing, that will come, but just looking for ways to enhance my brand. That is kind of how we look at it.\"\n\nWith the sudden changes in college recruiting these days with NIL, any school can up the offer at any given time. It\'s fair to say all four of Abrams\' top schools still have a shot with him prior to Wednesday at 5 p.m., but there\'s no denying that Michigan is trending up in a big way.\n\nWith Abrams set to make his commitment in a couple days, another top linebacker target in the 2026 class is taking more time to make the proper decision. Four-star Duyon Forkpa was originally planning on announcing his commitment this past weekend, but he instead chose to delay his decision.\n\n\"I\'m just not sure on the school right now,\" Forkpa told Rivals\' Chad Simmons ($). \"I really like Florida and playing in the SEC on that national state, but Florida State and Michigan have been talking to me a lot, too.\"\n\nFlorida State, Florida and Michigan are the three finalists, and a lot of the buzz is surrounding the Wolverines right now. Michigan is making a late push, and Forkpa has a lot to think about now.\n\n\"I just have to figure out the best fit for me,\" he said. \"Michigan, Florida and Florida State are all in now. I am not sure when I will make a decision now. I will probably go to games first and make a decision during the season. I\'ve been talking to all three, all three have stuff I like and I have to take more time.\"\n\nIt\'s unclear when he will make an announcement, but Forkpa isn\'t going to rush a decision just for the sake of doing so. But the fact he delayed his commitment is clearly great news for the Wolverines\' chances of landing him.\n\nSomehow, there is still a defensive lineman on the board for the Wolverines in the 2026 class. Four-star Deuce Geralds is set announce his commitment on Aug. 2, and Michigan is one of his finalists along with Ohio State, LSU, Oregon and Ole Miss.\n\nJust a few weeks before his commitment date, Geralds still has yet to lock in what his decision will be.\n\n\"I am just going off how I feel,\" Geralds told Rivals\' Simmons ($). \"I am praying on it. All five schools have recruited me well, each has made me feel like a priority and I still have to figure out which one is best for me. l am still working to find where I want to be.\"\n\nMichigan has had a lot of success turning defensive linemen into NFL talent in recent years, and Geralds knows that. It is a big factor in his recruitment.\n\n\"They develop defensive linemen there,\" he said of Michigan. \"Coach Espo is a great coach, he feels I am a plug-and-play guy there and I have a great connection with coach (Sherrone) Moore. Life after football is great there too with their alumni program.\"', 'https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/g6pE9vyo_c-OoGiJOhACtefOqDA=/0x0:2400x1200/fit-in/1200x600/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25136045/usa_today_22023372.jpg', 'https://www.maizenbrew.com/2025/7/14/24466344/michigan-football-recruiting-deuce-geralds-nick-abrams-duyon-forkpa-anthony-davis', 'Maize n Brew', 'Scotty White', 'dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out, dmoz/Society/Advice, dmoz/Recreation/Climbing/Tree Climbing, dmoz/Health/Education/High School Health, news/Sports', '2025-07-14 07:00:00', '2025-07-14 07:04:25', '2025-07-14 07:04:25'),

He died after a prolonged illness in a London hospital.\n\nPREMIUM TIMES reported that former Nigerian presidents have paid tribute to his life, saying he served the nation with character and patriotism.\n\nThey remembered him as a courageous leader, a disciplined military officer, and a committed public servant who made considerable contributions to Nigeria\'s peace and progress.\n\nAlso, the Jama\'atu Nasril Islam (JNI), under the leadership of Sultan of Sokoto Sa\'ad Abubakar, commiserated with the nation over the former president\'s passing.\n\nThe group extolled Mr Buhari\'s contributions to public service, recalling him for his simplicity, restraint, and calm approach to leadership.\n\n\"In his various capacities, he remained devoted to the ideals he believed would contribute to national growth.\"\n\nNiger, Enugu governor mourns.\n\nGovernor Umar Bago of Niger State described Mr Buhari as an esteemed elder statesman whose contributions to Nigeria\'s history are indelible.\n\nMr Bago said the late president\'s legacies, \"encompassing various agricultural and security reforms, will long be remembered despite the numerous challenges faced during his administration.\"\n\nHe said Mr Buhari\'s tenure was marked by significant efforts to combat corruption and improve the nation\'s infrastructure, including the expansion of railways, rehabilitation of major roads, and the initiation of the Social Investment Programmes (SIP).\n\nIn his reaction, Governor Peter Mbah remembered the former president as one of the most patriotic and honest Nigerian leaders to have ever led the country.\n\n\"Although he leaves behind a void that will be difficult to fill, there is much comfort in the fact that his life was an inspiration, and his vast legacies are engraved in the sands of time.\"\n\nThe former Minister of Works and Housing, Babatunde Fashola, who served for eight years in Mr Buhari\'s administration, said the former president has a record of service to Nigeria that is almost unparalleled. \"From the battlefield to the ballot box, he stood as a sentinel of duty. As a military officer, Head of State, and twice-elected President, he dedicated over five decades of his life to the service of our nation in times of strife and in peaceful times -- guided always by a belief in discipline, integrity, and nationhood.\"\n\n\"What often went unnoticed in public commentary was his unwavering commitment to the core values that bind any serious society: order, punctuality, and accountability. He did not just talk about these values; he lived them.\n\n\"Under his leadership, the nation confronted formidable challenges: insurgency, economic volatility, a global pandemic, and deep political tension. Yet he remained consistent -- never ruled by noise or poll ratings, only by the burden of responsibility and his belief in posterity\'s judgment,\" Mr Fashola wrote in a statement sent to PREMIUM TIMES.\n\nThe Zazzau Emirate also extended its deepest condolences to the family of the former president. A statement issued by the emirate, personally signed by the Emir of Zazzau, Ahmed Bamalli, praised Mr Buhari\'s legacy, describing his life as \"a testament to integrity, resilience, and service.\"\n\n\"We stand with you in this time of grief, and our prayers and thoughts are with you all,\" the traditional ruler said.', 'https://media.premiumtimesng.com/wp-content/files/2023/05/FwwhbDOaEAAX7Iv.jpeg', 'https://www.premiumtimesng.com/news/top-news/807085-more-tributes-pour-in-for-former-president-muhammadu-buhari.html', 'Premium Times Nigeria', 'Kabir Yusuf', 'dmoz/Society/Death, dmoz/Health/Fitness/Advice and Guides, news/Politics', '2025-07-14 07:01:12', '2025-07-14 07:04:26', '2025-07-14 07:04:26'),

But the plan has plenty of precedent\n\nDuring the New York City mayoral primary campaign, Zohran Mamdani\'s proposal for a citywide rent freeze became a contentious top', 'The Democratic mayoral candidate has faced controversy over his calls for a rent freeze. But the plan has plenty of precedent\n\nDuring the New York City mayoral primary campaign, Zohran Mamdani\'s proposal for a citywide rent freeze became a contentious topic. The Democratic nominee says to achieve a cap on annual rent increases for the city\'s 1m rent-stabilized apartments, he would appoint members to the city\'s rent guidelines board who support it. Critics decry a rent freeze as a pie-in-the-sky, unrealistic proposal.\n\nI served as a rent guidelines board member for nearly four years, appointed by then mayor Bill de Blasio in 2018. And it\'s clear this controversy isn\'t just about rent freezes - there\'s a larger agenda to deregulate rent-stabilized housing, under which rent ceilings prevent landlords from raising the rent too high and tenants must be offered renewal leases (unless the landlord shows legal reason not to).\n\nIn 2023, a report revealed that half of New Yorkers couldn\'t afford basic needs such as housing, transportation, food and healthcare. This is the New York that I grew to know intimately before I joined the board. I\'d been a tenants\' rights attorney for years under the city\'s right-to-counsel program, representing hundreds of low-income families facing eviction who could not afford their own attorneys. Each week, I entered housing court to find my clients - families with toddlers, seniors with disabilities and food delivery drivers - anxiously awaiting possible eviction. It\'s not just low-income tenants at the mercy of landlords. Over the last 12 years, I\'ve listened to thousands of stories and the one common thread is how easy it is for a moderate-income person to wind up homeless. Sudden unemployment, unexpected disability coupled with a rent increase, and now you\'re fighting like hell to survive housing court and not join the 350,000 homeless New Yorkers. For these New Yorkers, a rent freeze isn\'t some out-of-touch idea; it\'s a lifeline.\n\nThe people who make that decision are nine board members, all appointed by the mayor - two tenant members (my former role), two landlord members and five public members whom the tenants and landlord members vie to win over to reach a majority vote. We don\'t rely on feelings or vibes - we\'re poring over reports and hours of public testimony, and engaging in spirited policy debates. In 2020, those reports revealed record unemployment spurred by the pandemic and an already high homelessness rate and rent burden (most tenants were paying 30% or more of their income on rent). Weighing that with landlord operating costs, the board voted to approve a rent freeze that year, and a partial rent freeze (for six months) the following year. In fact, the board voted for a rent freeze four times over the last 10 years under the de Blasio administration (the board votes every summer on these rent levels and they take effect in the fall). This is why criticisms of Mamdani\'s rent freeze ring hollow for me - it\'s painted as out of touch, yet there\'s already a precedent, backed by government reports and data.\n\nIt is essential for the public to understand that there is a broader agenda behind the \"rent freezes are bad\" argument. Undermining freezes is part of a larger goal to weaken rent stabilization, which landlords have consistently sought to do - and they were nearly successful recently.\n\nWhile I was on the board, landlords sued the rent guidelines board and all of its members (including me!) in federal court, claiming that rent stabilization amounted to an \"unconstitutional taking\": if the government tells me how much I can increase my rent by and when I can terminate a lease, then the government is interfering with my private property without just compensation, the argument goes.\n\nFor years, there had been whispers that New York landlords were rubbing their hands together, eager to devise ways to get such a case before the US supreme court - and this one came dangerously close. I still remember when I got the call four years after the case traveled its way up the federal appeals court chain: \"The court declined to hear the case!\"\n\nSupreme court cases aren\'t selected in a vacuum - the court often grants certiorari , or agrees to hear a case, when there is a broad public interest, leading some parties to drum up support for their cause strategically. When I was on the board, I often heard the dichotomy of the good landlord versus the bad tenant. It\'s become so popular, you\'ve probably been inundated with these stories too. \"Professional tenants\" who sign a lease, then never pay rent. TikToks about tenants leaving an apartment in disarray. Squatters. Rent-stabilized tenants who are secretly wealthy, gaming the system by paying low rent. All designed to lead you to the conclusion that \"rent stabilization shouldn\'t exist\". You\'d never know that the median household income for rent-stabilized tenants is a modest $60,000. Or that eviction rates are so high that the New York City housing court doesn\'t have enough judges to handle the volume of cases it sees daily.\n\nJust last year, in yet another case that landlords asked the supreme court to review, the court declined, but Justice Clarence Thomas signaled the court would be interested in hearing a rent stabilization challenge and even provided a legal roadmap for how to bring it. Landlords don\'t want to reform rent stabilization - they want it done away with.\n\nAt the end of the day, when the goal is profit and power is unchecked, it will be profits over people. Mamdani\'s proposals are a threat to the real estate industry because they signal a mayorship that doesn\'t ascribe to the tenet that government must sit back and let the market come to its own conclusion - all while millions of New Yorkers are trying to avoid housing court.', 'https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3eddcf1f164d6075c99f63770184e6d6bcd68ccd/499_0_5018_4016/master/5018.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctb3BpbmlvbnMucG5n&s=17ebfce12b8f7bd8fb0482ae24bd2d60', 'https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2025/jul/14/new-york-rent-freeze-zohran-mamdani', 'The Guardian', NULL, 'dmoz/Society/Law/Legal Information, dmoz/Society/Issues/Intellectual Property, dmoz/Society/Advice, dmoz/Society/Issues/Property Rights, dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Job-Related, news/Politics', '2025-07-14 07:00:08', '2025-07-14 07:04:26', '2025-07-14 07:04:26'),

This is the best gaming CPU on the market right now, and it\'s paired with AMD\'s best GPU offering in the form of the RX 9070 XT. In fact, this is a pretty great all-around high-end build.\n\nLast week the retail gods blessed us with some great gaming PCs for very reasonable prices for Prime Day (er, week?). After months of Nvidia-beating prices from AMD builds, I was surprised to find that the best gaming PC deal was for a Zotac Nvidia RTX 5080 build. But now that\'s out of stock, everything has returned to its natural order, and we\'re once again left with AMD taking the value reins. Case in point, this all-AMD iBuyPower Y40 Pro for $2,000 at Best Buy.\n\nThe AMD RX 9070 XT is AMD\'s best graphics card and competes closely with the Nvidia RTX 5070 Ti, losing out mainly in ray tracing performance (though not by the massive margins of days of yore) and, of course, its lack of Multi Frame Gen. In his RX 9070 XT vs RTX 5070 Ti comparison, our Dave concluded that for the same price he\'d probably opt for the RTX 5070 Ti. But therein lies the kicker: for the same price.\n\nI spent an unfathomable amount of time browsing through gaming PC deals for Prime Day last week, and I\'m still yet to find a pre-built gaming PC as well-rounded as this RX 9070 XT build for $2,000 or less. The RTX 5070 Ti builds I\'m seeing in this price bracket just can\'t stand up to the sweet chip, RAM, and storage combo on offer in this iBuyPower build.\n\nThis build is somewhat of a known quantity, too, because while we\'ve not got our hands on this specific model, our Jacob Ridley did try out a similar previous-gen model. Apart from being a little loud, it was pretty solid all-round.\n\nReturning to this Y40, you\'re getting some stellar core specs. The Ryzen 7 9800X3D is the best CPU for gaming on the market right now, thanks to the copious amount of cache that it sits on top of. And 32 GB of DDR5 RAM is ideal for gaming today, too -- although 5,200 MT/s isn\'t the fastest -- and 2 TB of storage is also the ideal amount for today\'s large game install sizes. In other words, in terms of its core specs, this build is pretty ideal all around.\n\nApart from the core specs, you\'re also getting a nice fish tank case in the iBuyPower Hyte Y40 Pro with a vertical GPU mount and a liquid cooler. The power supply is shrouded, too, of course, so you can just have all the cool parts displayed (sorry, PSUs).\n\nIt also comes with a free mouse and keyboard, though you\'ll want to upgrade those sooner rather than later.

Best known for his ethereal fabric sculptures of domestic spaces, the South Korean artist has spent decades constructing intricate homages to the buildings in which he has lived, all the while ruminating on the notion of home as both a physical structure and a deeply emotional experience. This spring, Suh\'s large-scale installations, sculptures, videos and drawings are the subject of a major survey at Tate Modern, the artist\'s largest in London since 2002. Bringing together works from the past three decades, Walk the House (1 May - 19 October) examines the complex relationship between architecture, the body and the memories that shape our lives, inviting visitors to join the artist in pondering the enigma of home: is it a place, a feeling or a construction of the mind?\n\nBorn in Seoul in 1962, Suh has led a relatively itinerant life, moving between cultures, languages and architectural surroundings. He initially studied traditional Korean art in his home country before migrating to the US in 1991, where he received a BFA in painting from Rhode Island School of Design in 1994 and an MFA in sculpture from Yale University in 1997. Since then he has based himself in New York, Berlin and London, frequently hopping back and forth between these locations. In the late 1990s he began exploring themes of place and identity by making brightly coloured one-to-one scale fabric sculptures of architectural interiors. Using diaphanous sheets of polyester, he has obsessively recreated his childhood home in South Korea and apartments and studios in Berlin, New York and London. \'My architecture pieces are all basically outlines,\' Suh has said of these walk-through sculptures that, supported by simple steel frames, give form to ideas about ideas about migration, displacement and transience. Several are on show at Tate Modern and, though they appear as precise as blueprints, Suh concedes that these ghostly structures are not 100% accurate. \'People think they are really precise,\' he has said. \'But, of course, I\'m not actually trying to exactly replicate a physical structure in fabric. It\'s more about capturing enough visual and physical information to evoke a sense of the space as I experienced it.\n\n\'Home started to exist for me when I no longer had it,\' said Suh, who regularly brings together multiple interior spaces in single installations. Referred to as \'Hubs\', these composite works invite visitors to explore interconnected rooms, corridors and entranceways that replicate domestic spaces from the cities in which the artist has resided. They are crafted using a combination of traditional Korean sewing techniques and cutting-edge 3D modelling and mapping technologies. Each one is filled with carefully embroidered architectural features, including door handles, electrical sockets and light switches. As you walk through these fragile structures it feels as though you are travelling back through time, moving between cultures, countries and even psychological states. \'Practically it\'s impossible to have all these spaces in one place,\' Suh has explained. \'So the work is related to my long-held desire to blur the boundaries of geographical distance.\' Indeed, the notion of collapsing space is central to these works, which the artist describes as \'suitcase homes\', a term that relates to a Korean expression referring to the hanok - a house that could theoretically be disassembled, transported and reassembled at a new site. As Suh has said, his desire is to \'carry my home with me all the time, like a snail\'.\n\nBesides his fabric works, Suh is known for his labour-intensive Rubbing/Loving projects, in which the contours of architectural surfaces are recorded through rubbing with graphite or coloured pencil on paper. One of the most ambitious of these, and on show at Tate Modern, is Rubbing/Loving Project: Seoul Home, 2013-22. The decade-long endeavour began with the artist completely covering his childhood home in Seoul with hundreds of small sheets of Mulberry paper. Suh then painstakingly traced each contour and texture of the building, rubbing every surface with graphite, from its terracotta tiles to its wooden beams. \'It\'s like caressing a surface, like you caress your lover,\' Suh has said of the process. \'There is also a level of intensity because you can\'t slacken, you cannot miss an area. You have to cover every surface. So there is a lot of devotion and caring through the process.\'\n\nSuh\'s house, which was designed by his father (a respected Korean philosopher and ink painter) in the 1970s, is a traditional Korean home based on a building in Gyeongbokgung Palace, the main palace of the Yi dynasty in Seoul. Built out of concern for the loss of Korean tradition as vernacular residences were being torn down and replaced by modern housing blocks, the home symbolises the father\'s desire to preserve Korean tradition. Suh\'s paper stayed fixed to the building\'s exterior for months, becoming weathered and worn before being cut away and painstakingly reassembled onto a wire frame to form a ghostly replica of the house. For Suh, his childhood home is a very special place, filled with memories of his upbringing and the special relationship he had with his father. This is why he has revisited the building time and time again, creating numerous pieces based on its interior and exterior spaces. \'This is where my father spent most of his time\', Suh has explained. \'All my upbringing was located there. The house is like a self-portrait, but it\'s a portrait of my father as well.\'\n\nThe title Rubbing/Loving plays on the difficulties that native Korean speakers encounter when pronouncing English words beginning with the letters \'R\' and \'L\', which results in them sounding almost identical. But for Suh, the action of rubbing is also associated with love. \'The gesture of rubbing is basically very caring,\' he has explained. \'There were multiple levels of emotion I went through during the process. A lot of memories had been accumulated within the space, and a lot of marks had been made there. Some I remembered before I started to do the rubbing, but some I completely forgot and I rediscovered them as I rubbed.\'\n\nFor the large-scale installation Rubbing/ Loving, 2016, Suh memorialised the interior of the New York apartment on West 22nd Street where he had resided for 18 years. As before, the process began with covering every surface with paper, including the cabinets, light switches and doorknobs but this time he used coloured pencil and pastel to create his rubbings. \'This project didn\'t become possible until I had to vacate the space,\' Suh recalled. \'When my landlord passed away, the building was sold and I had to move out. I decided that the last piece I would make in the space would be a rubbing of all the interiors in the entire building.\' Suh spent two years on the project, meticulously rubbing and caressing every surface with his fingertips. In doing so, he indexed every scratch, dent and imperfection - the accumulated vestiges of a human presence. Just as Seoul Home became a poignant memorial to the artist\'s father, the process of making this work became \'an extended ritual\' to commemorate his time in the house and his warm friendship with his former landlord, Arthur. At their core, these Rubbing/Loving projects speak to the transient nature of home, memory and the emotional imprints we leave behind in the spaces we inhabit.\n\nAmong Suh\'s smaller pieces on display at Tate Modern are his Thread Drawings, works on paper made using threads stitched into soluble gelatin tissue. These are sewn in the same way as his architectural fabric sculptures and feature a similarly vibrant colour palette. But once immersed in water, the gelatin dissolves and the threads fuse with the handmade paper, leaving skeletal images of architectural facades, staircases light switches, fire extinguishers and other motifs familiar from the artist\'s large-scale works. Suh developed the process during a residency at Singapore Tyler Print Institute in 2010, creating pictures that lie somewhere between two and three dimensions. Staircase, Ground Floor, 348 West 22nd Street, New York, NY 10011, USA, 2016, takes the form of a red staircase yet at the same time appears like a discarded negligee. Drawing out connections between architectural space, clothing and the body, such works underscore Suh\'s fascination with the interconnected spaces we inhabit and their relationship to identity formation. In contrast, other, cartoon-like drawings, such as My Homes, 2010, anthologises an array of zany and humorous concepts: a house that runs on legs or that radiates out of the artist\'s head, or lies balanced on his shoulders.\n\nMore recently, Suh has begun using video to explore his themes, most notably in the 2018 installation Robin Hood Gardens, which documents the interiors and exteriors of the condemned Robin Hood Gardens housing estate in Poplar, east London. Suh\'s panoramic film, which was commissioned by the V&A for the 2018 Venice Architecture Biennale, employs 3D scanning, photogrammetry, time-lapse photography and drone footage to create an intriguing portrait of the iconic 1972 brutalist housing estate designed by Alison and Peter Smithson. The camera pans vertically and horizontally along walkways and through the building, moving from one domestic interior to another to create a visual journey that addresses notions of home, memory and displacement within a physical structure on the verge of demolition. Suh was particularly drawn to the site\'s \'intangible quality\' as much as its architectural structure: the \'energy, history, life and memory that has accumulated there\'.\n\nThe exhibition culminates in a space dedicated to Suh\'s ongoing Perfect Home: The Bridge Project, for which the artist, working with a team of architects, engineers, programmers and animators, has developed a series of speculative prototypes for bridges that propose ways to connect his home in Seoul with his home in New York. Each bridge uses different technologies and structures to contend with issues of climate, geology, biodiversity and human activity. One runs over the Arctic, cutting a path through buildings and mountains, while another follows a straight path between the two cities. The latter crosses the Pacific on a series of floating pods with special mechanisms designed to keep them stationary despite the ocean\'s restless currents. Presented as an experimental lab within the gallery space, the project features drawings, animations, videos and specific environmental datasets covering ocean currents, tides, wind, temperature, precipitation, natural disasters, the migratory routes of aviary and marine life, and so on. The plans also take into account geopolitical factors such as missile testing, as well as the migratory patterns of humans via air, land and ocean. It\'s a fantastical project, whose imaginary links between disparate places and cultures reflect Suh\'s enduring interest in the relationship between identity and globalisation.\n\nWith issues of migration and displacement increasingly at the forefront of current affairs, Suh\'s sculptures, drawings and videos seem more relevant than ever. The pieces on show at Tate Modern ask profound questions about the nature of home and what it means to belong. Home, they suggest, is not a fixed place but a shifting, spectral presence - something that exists as much in memory as it does in reality.

NICE guidelines for the two conditions for which antipsychotics can be core treatments (psychosis and bipolar disorder) are comprehensive. They recommend that secondary care specialists should prescribe any antipsychotics to CYP and also undertake/manage initial regular health monitoring for at least the first 12 months before patients may be transferred to primary care (general practitioners) for continuing aftercare under \'shared care\' arrangements.\n\nAlthough antipsychotics are not recommended for core treatment of autism or Tourette\'s, NICE guidelines for CYP with these conditions both include information about short off-label use for specific severe symptoms. The advice on antipsychotics prescribing and aftercare is, however, rudimentary and makes no reference to the more detailed best practice guidelines.\n\nInappropriate use\n\nAntipsychotics may also be used more widely, and concern about inappropriate use of psychotropic drugs to manage \'challenging behaviour\' has led to an NHS-supported project (started in 2018) to reduce their use among CYP and to some recent more comprehensive NICE recommendations for CYP with learning difficulties.\n\nThis new study focused on the four mental health conditions explicitly linked to antipsychotics treatment in NICE guidelines, using encoded English general practice data linked to hospital admission and outpatient data. The sample of CYP, aged 5 to 17 years, was representative of the English general population and the study had three aims - describe recorded trends in in antipsychotics prescribing; describe recoded reasons for prescribing and treatment lengths; and compare recorded levels of health monitoring in general practices between CYP with antipsychotics prescriptions and those with mental health condition diagnoses but no antipsychotics prescription.\n\nDr Vinogradova said: \"Our findings showed rises in levels of antipsychotics prescribing to CYP between 2006 and 2021 - greater in adolescence than in childhood and greatest among adolescent females. Encoded indications for CYP prescribed antipsychotics appeared concerning - only just under half were for one of our focus mental health conditions and 62% of these were for autism. Just over a third had only mental health symptoms or associated illnesses recorded, and just under one fifth had no records of mental health problems. Some antipsychotics treatment lengths also appeared concerning, particularly those linked to autism, Tourette\'s, ADHD (attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder), learning difficulties and self-harm.\n\n\"Compared to NICE recommendations for CYP with psychosis or bipolar disorder, recorded health monitoring levels were generally low, but lower for autism or Tourette\'s than for psychosis or bipolar disorder. More patients had records for basic health monitoring (heart or other body-related measurements) than for laboratory tests.\"\n\nFurther study needed with more complete data\n\nShe added: \"Taken at face value, these findings appear to be disturbing evidence of lack of adherence to NICE guidelines, both with respect to the prescribing of antipsychotics to CYP and to the levels of aftercare given by general practitioners. Our interpretation, however, is more nuanced. We suspect that the encoded general practitioner records for these complex and multifaceted conditions fail to reflect the full history of individual treatments, and that studies with access to more complete data will be needed to audit accurately adherence to best practice.\n\n\"Our study also identified the need for streamlined, centralised and condition independent best practice recommendations for antipsychotics treatments for CYP, covering core and off-label treatments and long and short exposures, to which all condition-related guidelines could point. Together with efforts to clarify key data flows and encoding responsibilities, these could optimise adherence across treatment environments and establish more reliable records for national audits.\"\n\nPossible reasons for the incompleteness of encoded general practitioner records are many, and impossible to rank clearly. The root cause is the separation of primary and secondary care patient records, with secondary care information transferred in text form when patients are sent back to primary care for ongoing treatment. General practices then need to re-encode the information, and incompleteness at any point in the process will lead to loss of data from specialists and hospitals. Although this is true for any illness involving primary and secondary care, it is particularly an issue here where the conditions are complex and often inter-related, and much of initial treatment and aftercare is allocated to secondary care.\n\nSimilar issues may also arise with respect to records of health monitoring in general practices. How this is done and by whom is not defined, but there are almost certainly a range of different data flows, and subsequent encoding and access solutions, all reflecting prevailing local resources. Auditing studies need certainty about the completeness of available data, so we conclude that a different research approach will be needed to establish reliable estimates of adherence to accepted best practice in the short to medium term.\n\nThe full study can be found here.\n\n/Public Release.

These volumes were then mapped to an RGB color scheme to create a blended attribute slice: 40 Hz to blue,', 'Spectral decomposition generated frequency-dependent amplitude volumes for 40 Hz (low-frequency), 70 Hz (mid-frequency), and 100 Hz (high-frequency). These volumes were then mapped to an RGB color scheme to create a blended attribute slice: 40 Hz to blue, 70 Hz to green, and 100 Hz to red, following standard seismic geomorphology workflows. The resulting RGB slices, representing key depositional time intervals of the reservoir units, were integrated with well-log facies characteristics to constrain and achieve high-resolution delineation of the depositional systems (Fig. 9).\n\nThe evolution of large-scale faults generally progresses through three distinct phases: isolated segment growth, soft linkage, and hard linkage. To delineate the spatio-temporal evolution of the boundary faults controlling the X Sag during the Kn interval, throw-displacement profiles were constructed for successive depositional stages. These profiles were refined using the maximum throw subtraction method (Fig. 2), which enabled a quantitative reconstruction of the fault growth histories.\n\nTwo boundary faults, F1 and F2, control the structural framework of the X Sag. The northern terminus of F1 intersects the southern terminus of F2 near seismic line L3275, justifying their combined analysis on a single throw-displacement plot (Fig. 2). Both faults exhibit progressive throw amplification from the T to T horizons. F1 consistently demonstrates greater throw magnitudes than F2 across all stages, indicating higher fault activity.\n\nFault F2, situated in the northern part of the study area, exhibits progressive along-strike lengthening over time. During the N1III-N1I intervals, it manifested as an isolated minor fault. In contrast, Fault F1 displays segmented growth patterns, with a prominent segmentation point at seismic line L2875, dividing it into northern (F1-1) and southern (F1-2) segments. Both segments strike NE-SW, with maximum throws of 1402 ms (F1-1) and 1320 ms (F1-2), respectively. The C-shaped displacement profile of F1, characterized by peak throws near its center that taper toward the tips, suggests an evolutionary process involving initial isolated segment growth, followed by lateral propagation and eventual linkage with F2 during the N10 interval. Notably, syn-sedimentary fault activity typically induces hanging-wall thickening. However, the absence of significant thickness variations perpendicular to the boundary faults during the N1III interval implies tectonic quiescence at this stage.\n\nReservoir petrology, stable heavy mineral assemblages, and the net-to-gross ratio collectively serve as robust proxies for sediment provenance. In this study, these three approaches are integrated to reconstruct the provenance system of the target interval.\n\nQFL (Quartz-Feldspar-Lithic) ternary diagrams, which correlate sandstone compositions (quartz, feldspar, lithic fragments) with tectonic settings (e.g., craton interior, recycled orogen, magmatic arc), were employed to delineate the provenance characteristics of the Kn interval.\n\nDuring the N1III depositional period, samples plot within the transitional arc, undissected arc, and dissected arc fields (Fig. 3D). The Well W74, located in the northern part of the study area, exhibits mixed transitional and dissected arc signatures, whereas the Well W25-3, situated in the southern part, clusters within the undissected arc field. These observations suggest the presence of two distinct provenance terrains, with more pronounced tectonic activity in the northern region.\n\nDuring the N1II depositional period, transitional arc signatures predominate, with the exception of the Well W36-4 in the northern part of the study area, which exhibits an undissected arc affinity (Fig. 3C). This pattern suggests enhanced provenance activity from the south, consistent with the trends observed during the N1III interval.\n\nDuring the N1I depositional period, both transitional and undissected arc domains are represented (Fig. 3B). The Well W20-3 (northwest) and the W77 (east) exhibit undissected arc signatures, indicating relatively weaker tectonic activity in the northwestern and eastern source areas compared to the southwest.\n\nDuring the N10 depositional period, all samples cluster within the transitional arc field (Fig. 3A), indicating intensified tectonic activity in the provenance regions. This pattern is consistent with the trends of boundary fault activation observed in \"Boundary fault characterization of the X sag\" and Fig. 2.\n\nThe QFL framework indicates that the Kn provenance system was consistently located within a magmatic arc tectonic setting, which can be further divided into transitional, dissected, and undissected subdomains. The upward-increasing transitional arc signatures from N1III to N10 (Fig. 3) suggest progressive tectonic intensification, consistent with the evolution of fault activity.\n\nStable heavy mineral assemblages, which are resistant to mechanical and chemical degradation during transport, serve as reliable indicators of provenance terrains. In the Kn interval of the X Sag, eight stable heavy mineral species were identified: zircon, titanite, rutile, garnet, apatite, tourmaline, magnetite, and leucoxene (Fig. 4). These assemblages exhibit pronounced spatial partitioning across different oil zones.\n\nDuring the deposition of N1III, six distinct stable heavy mineral associations were identified (Fig. 4D): ① Zircon-apatite (AHM1), ② Apatite-zircon (AHM2), ③ Zircon-magnetite-garnet (AHM3), ④ Zircon-apatite-leucoxene (AHM4), ⑤ Zircon-apatite-magnetite (AHM5), ⑥Magnetite-zircon (AHM6).\n\nDuring the deposition of N1II, six stable heavy mineral associations were identified (Fig. 4C): ① Zircon-apatite-leucoxene (AHM7), ② Apatite-zircon-garnet (AHM8), ③ Zircon-apatite-leucoxene-garnet (AHM9), ④ Leucoxene-zircon (AHM10), ⑤ Zircon-magnetite-apatite (AHM11), ⑥ Zircon-apatite (AHM12).\n\nDuring the deposition of N1I, five stable heavy mineral associations were identified (Fig. 4B): 0① Zircon-apatite-leucoxene (AHM13) with subordinate magnetite, ② Zircon-magnetite-apatite (AHM14), ③ Zircon-leucoxene-apatite (AHM15), ④ Zircon-apatite-magnetite (AHM16), ⑤ Zircon-apatite-magnetite with minor garnet/leucoxene (AHM17).\n\nDuring the deposition of N10, five stable heavy mineral associations were identified, exhibiting spatial variability across different sub-sags of the study area (Fig. 4A): ① Western Sag: Zircon-apatite (AHM18), ② Western Sag: Zircon-apatite-leucoxene (AHM19), ③ Western Sag: Zircon-apatite-leucoxene-magnetite (AHM20), ④ Southern Sag: Zircon-apatite-leucoxene-garnet (AHM21), ⑤ Northeastern Sag: Zircon-apatite (AHM22).\n\nThis temporal evolution reveals six discrete provenance inputs during the N1III-N1II intervals, which reduce to five dominant sources in the N1I-N10 intervals. This pattern reflects dynamic sediment routing reorganization.\n\nThe net-to-gross ratio, defined as the proportion of sandstone thickness within a given stratigraphic unit, serves as an effective indicator of sediment provenance. Particularly under conditions of similar A/S ratios, the net-to-gross ratio exhibits a consistent variation trend along the direction of sediment transport.\n\nDuring the N1III sedimentary period, the net-to-gross ratio of the reservoir generally decreased from the periphery towards the central and eastern parts (Fig. 5D). This trend is consistent with the provenance directions indicated by the distribution of stable heavy minerals, which point towards the northwest, southwest, west, south, and northeast. In contrast, the provenance from the southeast direction was not prominently indicated. During this period, the accommodation space was relatively small, while the sediment supply from the provenance areas was sufficient. However, the sediment supply from the southeast direction was relatively weak and, influenced by stronger provenances from other directions, its contribution was not significant.\n\nDuring the N1II sedimentary period, the net-to-gross ratio of the reservoir generally exhibited a pattern of being higher in the western and central regions, and lower in the eastern region (Fig. 5C). Along the direction of sediment transport, the net-to-gross ratio decreased, aligning well with the provenance directions from the northwest, southwest, west, southeast, and northeast as indicated by the distribution of stable heavy minerals. Moreover, the distribution pattern of the net-to-gross ratio during this period was similar to that observed during the N1III sedimentary period. Enhanced sediment supply under reduced accommodation obscured signals from the southern provenance.\n\nDuring the N1I sedimentary period, the accommodation space increased while the sediment supply weakened, resulting in a higher A/S ratio. The net-to-gross ratio of the reservoir exhibited a pattern of being higher in the western and northern regions, and lower in the eastern region (Fig. 5B).\n\nDuring the N10 sedimentary period, the accommodation space continued to increase, while the sediment supply capacity further weakened, resulting in an elevated A/S ratio. The net-to-gross ratio exhibited a pattern of being higher in the western region and lower in the eastern region (Fig. 5A). These variation trends are consistent with the provenance directions indicated by heavy mineral assemblages. The southeast sector represents a sediment-underfed zone, exhibiting minimal net-to-gross values.\n\nTo reconstruct the western sediment delivery system, including provenance capacity and sediment routing pathways, during the K₁n₁ interval in the X Sag, we analyzed the basement relief west of the boundary faults. Given minimal post-K₁n₁ structural reorganization, the present-day basement topography is interpreted to represent the paleo-provenance erosion zone. Using Global Mapper, we extracted drainage divides and paleo-fluvial networks from this erosion zone (Fig. 6). Significant geomorphic contrasts between the northwestern and southeastern sectors allowed us to subdivide the area into two distinct drainage basins.\n\nThe geomorphology of the northwest drainage area is characterized by a topography that is lower in the west and higher in the east. The watershed is situated adjacent to the boundary fault that controls the sag. As a result, the channels to the west of the watershed are impeded and cannot transport sediments eastward. In contrast, the northeastern region receives sediment supply from the drainage area on the eastern side of the watershed, forming a proximal channels system (Fig. 6). This configuration effectively blocks westward-flowing fluvial systems, channeling sediments through paleovalleys eastward into the sag. Consequently, this watershed forms a \"proximal catchment area\" on the west side of the boundary fault controlling the sag.\n\nThe geomorphology of the southwest drainage area is characterized by a topography that is higher in the west and lower in the east. The watershed is situated on the western side of the southwest drainage area. A significant elevation difference exists between the eastern and western sides of this geomorphic unit within the southwest drainage area. The channels on the eastern side are characterized by their extensive area and high density. These observations indicate that the southwest drainage area represents a large provenance denudation zone with a robust sediment supply capacity.\n\nIn this study, based on the 3D seismic data of the study area, three paleovalleys (V1, V2, and V3) were identified in the western part of the study area (Fig. 7). These paleovalleys formed during periods of rapid base-level decline in the steep-slope areas of the lacustrine basin. They represent sediment transportation channels created by the erosion of pre-deposited strata surfaces by rivers and other erosive agents. The seismic reflections of these paleovalleys typically exhibit a concave-bottom pattern with bidirectional internal filling. Locally, chaotic reflection characteristics can also be observed.\n\nThe cross-sectional area of paleovalleys is indicative of their sediment transportation capacity. Seismic profiles reveal that the three paleovalleys (V1, V2, and V3) developed successively. Specifically, V1 and V3 developed during the sedimentary period from N10 to N1III, while V2 developed during the sedimentary period from N10 to N1II. Based on their cross-sectional areas, the sediment transportation capacities of the paleovalleys are ranked as follows: V1 > V3 > V2.\n\nSeismic, logging, and core data collectively indicate that three distinct sedimentary environments have developed within the Kn interval of Sag X: the fan delta front subfacies, lacustrine facies, and braided delta front subfacies.\n\nThe studied lithologic assemblage is predominantly composed of gray tuffaceous siltstone, gray tuffaceous sandy conglomerate, and gray to grayish-green mudstone. Core observations from eight representative wells (including Well W7-6) reveal well-developed sedimentary structures characteristic of high-energy depositional environments, such as parallel bedding, cross-bedding, and massive bedding. Distinct scour surfaces at the base of subaqueous distributary channels provide compelling evidence of paleocurrent activity. Log facies exhibit typical box-shaped and finger-shaped morphologies, with subordinate funnel-shaped configurations. Seismic reflection patterns display medium-frequency, low-amplitude waveforms with moderate-to-low continuity, demonstrating characteristic moderate-angle progradational infilling geometries (Fig. 8).\n\nThe depositional environment is interpreted as a fan-delta front subfacies. The coarser-grained lithologies and sedimentary structures, particularly the subaqueous distributary channel scour surfaces, collectively indicate high-energy hydrodynamic conditions within this depositional system. These sedimentary features align with the depositional mechanisms described by Li et al. (2024) for rift basin settings, where fan deltas transport coarse-grained sediments into lacustrine environments. The thick-bedded box-shaped sandy conglomerates and siltstones represent subaqueous distributary channel microfacies, while the finger-shaped siltstones and silty mudstones correspond to sheet sands. The interbedded thin mudstone layers are interpreted as interdistributary bay deposits, with the funnel-shaped silty mudstones characteristic of mouth bar accumulations.\n\nThe lithologic assemblage is predominantly composed of mudstone, tuffaceous siltstone, and tuffaceous fine sandstone, characterized by grayish-brown, grayish-green, and grayish-brown coloration. Core analysis reveals sedimentary structures such as massive bedding, horizontal laminations, wavy laminations, and mudstone rip-up clasts. Wireline log signatures exhibit serrated linear, serrated funnel-shaped, and serrated box-shaped patterns in gamma-ray (GR) and resistivity curves. Seismic reflection configurations display high-frequency, moderate-to-strong amplitude waveforms with parallel to subparallel reflection geometries.\n\nThe depositional environment is interpreted as lacustrine facies, further subdivided into deep-semi-deep lacustrine and shore-shallow lacustrine subfacies. The presence of wavy laminations suggests wave-modified depositional processes, while horizontal laminations indicate low-energy hydrodynamic conditions during sediment accumulation. This interpretation is corroborated by the characteristic high-frequency, parallel to subparallel seismic facies. In the Well W25-3, horizontally laminated dark gray mudstones represent quiescent water deposition, interpreted as deep-semi-deep lake subfacies. Thick box-shaped log motifs of tuffaceous siltstone correspond to lacustrine bar deposits. The presence of conglomerate fragments in core samples from the Well W35-2 indicates significant wave reworking. The serrated funnel-shaped and thin box-shaped siltstone units in the Well W35-1 are diagnostic of beach sand.\n\nThe lithologic suite in the Well W82 is predominantly composed of green mudstones and gray fine sandstones, with subordinate grayish-white siltstones and gray argillaceous siltstones. Wireline log motifs display serrated thin box-shaped, medium-amplitude bell-shaped, and serrated funnel-shaped patterns. Seismic facies characterization reveals medium-to-low frequency waveforms with moderate-to-weak amplitudes, exhibiting subparallel reflection configurations with low-angle progradational infill features. These seismic units display sheet-like to weakly wedge-shaped external geometries, predominantly distributed within the gentle slope area of the study region.\n\nThis depositional system, located in the gentle slope zone, is interpreted as a braided delta front subfacies. The thin box-shaped log patterns of fine sandstones represent subaqueous distributary channel microfacies, where serrated curve features indicate significant wave-modification processes. Serrated funnel-shaped siltstone units correspond to mouth bars, while bell-shaped siltstone motifs are diagnostic of sheet sand accumulation.\n\nAs previously analyzed, four subfacies and twelve microfacies are developed within the study area. Within the fan-delta front subfacies, four microfacies are identified: subaqueous distributary channels, mouth bars, sheet sands, and subaqueous distributary interchannel areas. Within the shore-shallow lacustrine subfacies, three microfacies are identified: beach sands, bar sands, and shore-shallow lacustrine mudstones. Within the braided delta front subfacies, four microfacies are identified: subaqueous distributary channels, mouth bars, sheet sands, and subaqueous distributary interchannel areas. Within the deep-semi-deep lacustrine subfacies, the deep-semi-deep lacustrine mudstone microfacies is identified.\n\nRGB seismic attribute slices, generated by assigning different colors to seismic volumes of varying frequencies, effectively highlight geological body boundaries through color contrasts and brightness variations. This technique has been widely applied in sedimentary system identification and reservoir prediction. In this study, seismic data volumes corresponding to 40 Hz (low frequency), 70 Hz (medium frequency), and 100 Hz (high frequency) were extracted. The 40 Hz volume was assigned blue, the 70 Hz volume green, and the 100 Hz volume red. These three frequency volumes were then fused to generate four RGB attribute slices along the target horizon (Fig. 9). This method leverages the unique characteristics of different frequency responses to enhance the visibility of geological features, making it particularly effective for identifying sedimentary facies and reservoir boundaries.\n\nBased on seismic reflection characteristics, well log responses, and geomorphological features, the depositional environments interpreted from the RGB slices are as follows (Figs. 9 and 10):', 'https://media.springernature.com/m685/springer-static/image/art%3A10.1038%2Fs41598-025-11451-7/MediaObjects/41598_2025_11451_Fig1_HTML.png', 'https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-025-11451-7', 'Nature', NULL, 'dmoz/Science/Earth Sciences, dmoz/Science/Earth Sciences/Geology, dmoz/Science/Earth Sciences/Geophysics, dmoz/Science/Earth Sciences/Paleogeography and Paleoclimatology, dmoz/Science/Earth Sciences/Geochemistry, news/Science', '2025-07-13 19:00:00', '2025-07-14 07:04:27', '2025-07-14 07:04:27'),

Credit- Imagn Images\n\nThe NFL transitioned to a 17-game season just four years ago, but discussions are already underway about adding another game and moving to an 18-game format. What was once speculation is now beginning to feel like an inevitable reality. While players technically have until 2030 to agree to such a change, or risk a lockout and forfeited game checks, serious negotiations won\'t begin until 2026.\n\nEven then, the earliest the league could implement an 18-game schedule would be in 2028. Not everyone is on board, though. Chiefs quarterback and face of the NFL, Patrick Mahomes, isn\'t enthusiastic about the prospect of playing 18 games. If the league does expand the season, he wants it to come with a second bye week for players.\n\nHowever, the NFL isn\'t warm to that proposal. Team owners are reportedly pushing for the 18-game schedule to retain the current structure, with just one bye week. Why the reluctance to add a second bye? According to NFL insider Mike Florio, it has everything to do with the league\'s long-term scheduling vision. The NFL is eyeing Presidents Day weekend as the ideal slot for the Super Bowl and plans to start the season the weekend after Labor Day. Adding a second bye would force the league to begin the season on Labor Day weekend -- something they haven\'t done since 2001 and are reluctant to revisit.\n\n\"I am all for that, but I don\'t think the league is. I think the league\'s position is going to be 18 games, one bye. And here\'s why. They got this fascination, as do many fans, and this is why the league is embracing it. President\'s Day weekend Super Bowl. If you add another game, most of your Super Bowls are going to land on Presidents Day weekend. If you got a second bye, then you got a problem, you\'re going to shoot President\'s Day weekend, or you\'ve got to start on Labour Day weekend.\"\n\nFlorio also warned that if the NFLPA ultimately agrees to the 18-game format -- which they might, especially if it comes with increased revenue sharing and the elimination of voluntary preseason activities -- it could just be the beginning. Once 18 games are normalized, the league could eventually push for 20, extending the regular season even further and placing greater demands on the players.\n\nBut even before the league pitches the idea to players -- or dives into the logistics, revenue projections, and scheduling, they must consider one crucial factor: player safety. Injuries, especially concussions, have been on the rise in recent years.\n\nIn response, the NFL has tried to mitigate risks by regularly updating rules and eliminating plays deemed dangerous. Still, adding another regular-season game would only heighten the risk of injury, particularly for quarterbacks -- the most protected yet frequently targeted players on the field.\n\nDespite these concerns and disapproval of players like Patrick Mahomes, an 18-game season feels inevitable. The NFL is confident players will eventually agree, especially if they offer them a larger slice of the revenue pie. League revenue has already surpassed the $20 billion mark and is expected to grow even further with increasingly lucrative media rights deals and expanded streaming opportunities.\n\nAn 18-game schedule would also allow for more international matchups, boosting global viewership and bringing in even more revenue -- a strong enough incentive for owners to push forward, regardless of the risks.', 'https://cdn-wp.thesportsrush.com/2025/07/079b6c21-untitled-design-2025-07-14t142154.082.jpg', 'https://thesportsrush.com/nfl-news-mike-florio-gives-a-reality-check-to-patrick-mahomes-amidst-18-game-season-chatter/', 'The SportsRush', 'Ayush Juneja', 'dmoz/Games, dmoz/Games/Board Games, dmoz/Games/Board Games/Historical, dmoz/Games/Board Games/Sports, news/Sports', '2025-07-14 06:53:28', '2025-07-14 07:04:27', '2025-07-14 07:04:27'),

Those are the 11th-best odds among the 15 teams in the messy, crowded American League.\n\nSo you\'re saying there\'s a ch -- it\'s ', 'CLEVELAND -- As of Sunday evening, FanGraphs assigned the Cleveland Guardians a 10.7 percent chance of snagging a playoff berth. Those are the 11th-best odds among the 15 teams in the messy, crowded American League.\n\nSo you\'re saying there\'s a ch -- it\'s not going to be easy. Only the Chicago White Sox and Athletics are really, truly out of the wild-card race. The Orioles have been mired in the AL East basement for a while and, rightfully, seem like soon-to-be sellers, but even they\'re only a few games behind the Guardians.\n\nThere\'s time to make a move, though. So, let\'s ignore those playoff odds for a moment and chart a path back to legitimate contention for the 46-49 Guardians.\n\nOh, well, that seems easy enough.\n\nThe Guardians own the 28th-best OPS in the league, ahead of only the White Sox and Pittsburgh Pirates. Beyond All-Stars José Ramírez and Steven Kwan, their next most dependable hitter is ... Kyle Manzardo? After that, um, Nolan Jones, maybe? Carlos Santana? This shouldn\'t be so difficult to answer. The lineup has been begging for some fresh blood for weeks. For this exercise, that can\'t remain the case. The Guardians have been playing at a self-designed disadvantage.\n\nEven if Chase DeLauter and/or C.J. Kayfus endure a rocky transition to the majors, they\'d still offer more of a threat at the plate than, say, Will Wilson or Johnathan Rodriguez have (assuming DeLauter checks out OK this week once he\'s evaluated for wrist soreness). The upside, on the other hand, is that the Guardians have better answers to the prompt above. If they have to move on from Santana to create space for a big league-ready prospect, that might be beneficial both in the present and future tenses. Santana has a .688 OPS and 40 birthday candles to blow out next spring.\n\nSo, find a role for DeLauter or Kayfus, and start plotting how Juan Brito can help in September. Give daily opportunities to Manzardo and Jones, and anyone else finding a rhythm. Pray that Lane Thomas can get healthy and find his old ways. And, hey, don\'t be afraid to get a head start on the offseason to-do list and survey the market for a controllable hitter this month. After all, it\'s not like they\'re magically going to arrive at spring training in 2026 with nine everyday starters ready to form an offensive juggernaut.\n\nThis is a front office that, no matter the team\'s position in the standings, likes to entertain such a trade. In 2021, for instance, as they shipped out César Hernández, Jordan Luplow and Eddie Rosario, they tried to convince the Pirates to hand over Bryan Reynolds. Instead, they acquired Myles Straw. Whoops.\n\nIt\'s looking like a mid-August return for Bieber, who is scheduled to start in the Arizona Complex League on Tuesday. If he avoids further setbacks (and assuming he opts out of his 2026 option), the Guardians will pay him $14 million for, oh, about eight starts. If they can tack on some postseason assignments to his workload, they\'ll deem it a sufficient investment.\n\nThe rotation has carried this team for weeks, and that must continue. Since June 1, Cleveland\'s rotation ranks fifth in the majors in ERA. Slade Cecconi has flourished. Gavin Williams has taken steps forward. Tanner Bibee, the de facto ace entering the season, has the highest ERA in Cleveland\'s rotation, though he has expressed confidence in recent weeks that his output will improve the rest of the way.\n\nIf Bieber can deliver anything close to what Matthew Boyd provided last year upon his return from Tommy John surgery -- and if Luis Ortiz doesn\'t set foot in Progressive Field again in 2025 -- a quintet of Bieber, Bibee, Williams, Cecconi and Logan Allen should be solid enough.\n\nIn this scenario, there\'s no Emmanuel Clase trade, because the Guardians need to lean on their bullpen the way they did last season. Contenders have been inquiring about his availability, and the Guardians could mull whether it\'s worth flipping him for some future lineup help. But in this exercise, the club can claw back into the race in part by delaying a potential Clase trade until winter, when he\'ll still have three years of team control remaining.\n\nNo, instead, the Guardians would keep Clase for the summer and fall and trust that he, Hunter Gaddis and Cade Smith can repeat their dominance from a year ago in the second half. Of course, those are unfairly lofty expectations; the 2024 bullpen was historically proficient. This is where the loss of Andrew Walters to season-ending surgery, Franco Aleman\'s Triple-A struggles and Tim Herrin\'s inconsistency are proving costly. All three were intended to provide mid- or late-inning insurance this year. Instead, there\'s been a lot of Matt Festa.\n\nCleveland\'s lineup isn\'t talented enough to fuel the team to frequent lopsided wins, so if the Guardians are going to get on a roll, they\'ll be regularly summoning their top relievers to protect narrow leads. They need more than three consistent relievers for that sort of task.\n\nNic Enright and Erik Sabrowski deserve more opportunities to gain entry to Stephen Vogt\'s circle of trust. Paul Sewald, now healthy, will factor into the equation. This team, however, could still use another arm in high-leverage situations, whether a more efficient Herrin or Joey Cantillo, or even an outsider. (Don\'t look up Trevor Stephan\'s Triple-A stats if you have a sensitive stomach.) It wouldn\'t be the worst idea to scour the relief market and see if anyone piques their interest, either a rental who wouldn\'t cost anything substantial, or a long-term option (think the Royals\' acquisition of Lucas Erceg last summer) who could stick around if Clase is dealt over the offseason.\n\nThey rebounded from their 10-game skid with a strong road trip through Houston and Chicago to close the half. Now it\'s time to flex their muscle against what should be inferior competition. They have three against the Athletics, four against the Orioles, three at the Royals and three against the Rockies to close out July. Can they go 9-4? There are winnable series in August, too, against the Twins, White Sox, Marlins, Braves, Diamondbacks and Rangers.\n\nAnd, sure, those same teams are noticing the Guardians on their schedules and thinking, \"Hmm, here\'s a chance to win a series against a feeble opponent.\" But all the Guardians have to do is follow this foolproof plan, and they\'ll make those clubs feel foolish for underestimating a team that toyed around in the first half only to turn it on when it matters most. They\'ll force them to watch as they speed past the Royals and Rangers and Twins and Angels and Rays and Mariners and anyone else standing between them and a ticket to October. What could go wrong?', 'https://static01.nyt.com/athletic/uploads/wp/2025/07/13202854/GettyImages-2224025828-scaled.jpg?width=1200&height=630&fit=cover', 'https://www.nytimes.com/athletic/6490990/2025/07/14/guardians-mlb-playoff-contention/', 'The New York Times', 'Zack Meisel', 'dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Useless Pages, dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out, dmoz/Recreation/Pets/Free Services, news/Sports', '2025-07-14 07:00:15', '2025-07-14 07:04:27', '2025-07-14 07:04:27'),

Here\'s how it works.', 'Protesters call for closure of the ICE detention center in Aurora, operated by private prison firm GEO Group, on July 7.

(Delilah Brumer/Colorado Newsline)\n\nPara leer esta historia en español, haga clic aquí.\n\nEvery other Sunday from 8 p.m. to 8 a.m., Raquel Lane-Arellano waits for calls from people across Colorado who may have spotted Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents. She has been volunteering for six years, but the first time her phone rang was in January. Now, for those 12 hours twice a month, the ringing rarely stops.\n\nOnce she gets a call, Lane-Arellano confirms the location with the often shaky voice on the other end of the phone. Then she notifies other volunteers, who drive out to the area. Their job is to determine whether the sighting is legitimate, document the scene, speak to locals and hand out \"Know Your Rights\" cards, but not to physically confront the agents.\n\nLane-Arellano volunteers as a dispatcher for a 24/7 hotline run by the Colorado Rapid Response Network, a coalition of immigration, religious and legal nonprofits. The network was founded in 2017 to document reported ICE sightings and has amassed about 3,000 volunteers across the state, according to organizers.\n\n\"The purpose is to make sure people have the facts and that we try to dissuade some fear,\" said Lane-Arellano, who is also the communications manager for the Colorado Immigrant Rights Coalition. \"Because what the Trump administration wants is for our people to be afraid all the time.\"\n\nSUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX\n\nThe network\'s member organizations include the ACLU Colorado, American Friends Service Committee, Mi Familia Vota and Together Colorado. The statewide hotline is the first of its kind in Colorado, and it also covers southern Wyoming, according to organizers. Its operations are similar to statewide ICE reporting hotlines in Oregon, Connecticut and New Jersey, as well as local hotlines in cities like Los Angeles and Detroit.\n\nThe Rapid Response Network has seen both hotline calls and volunteer interest skyrocket since President Donald Trump took office for his second term, due to an uptick in immigration enforcement. Colorado is a particular focus of Trump\'s push for mass deportations, and he has singled out Aurora for enforcement operations.\n\nBetween Trump\'s inauguration and mid-June, ICE arrests in Colorado have nearly quadrupled compared to the same period last year, according to ICE data obtained by UC Berkeley researchers. The researchers found that 1,360 people have been arrested by ICE in Colorado under the second Trump administration, and many have no criminal record. The Colorado ICE data shows more than 400 arrested people marked as \"other immigration violator,\" as opposed to \"convicted criminal\" or \"pending criminal charges.\"\n\nOne of those arrests was of prominent immigrant rights advocate Jeanette Vizguerra, who has lived in the U.S. since 1997 and is currently in ICE detention. Her lawyers have alleged in federal court that her arrest was in retaliation for protected speech.\n\nThe administration\'s immigration crackdown received a major funding boost through the Republican tax break and spending cut bill that Trump signed earlier this month. The bill devotes $170 billion to border security, immigration enforcement and the hiring of thousands more ICE agents, among other Trump priorities.\n\nNetwork at odds with ICE\n\nThe Rapid Response Network calls its volunteers who approach and document areas with a reported ICE presence \"confirmers.\" These volunteers undergo a confirmer training. The network advises noncitizens against becoming confirmers due to the risks of entering areas where ICE might be conducting raids.\n\nAndrea Loya serves as the director of the immigrant support nonprofit Casa De Paz, but outside of work she also volunteers as a confirmer. In her six months volunteering, she has gone out more than 10 times, and she said each situation is unique.\n\nEach time she gets a call from a dispatcher, she grabs a megaphone, flyers with immigrant rights information and her phone. During her outings, she remains in frequent communication with other network volunteers to ensure they know she is safe, and so they can post social media updates about whether ICE is in fact present at the reported location. Loya said she has never spoken to ICE agents, and she keeps her distance while around them.\n\nLoya characterized the role of the network as that of a neighborhood watch group: to document unwanted activities and inform residents.\n\n\"It\'s important for us to counter the narrative that what we\'re doing is illegal,\" Loya said. \"It\'s just a neighborhood watch, the kind of thing people have been doing for years. When you enter really nice neighborhoods and park there, people come up and ask you what you\'re doing. That\'s what we\'re doing, but in our communities.\"\n\nIt\'s just a neighborhood watch, the kind of thing people have been doing for years. When you enter really nice neighborhoods and park there, people come up and ask you what you\'re doing. That\'s what we\'re doing, but in our communities.\n\n- Andrea Loya, Colorado Rapid Response Network volunteer\n\nThe Department of Homeland Security and ICE\'s Denver field office have condemned the network for allegedly interfering with immigration enforcement operations. Representatives of the Denver field office declined an interview request for this story.\n\n\"Groups like this interfere with ICE\'s ability to keep communities safe,\" the Denver field office said in a statement.\n\nThe Denver field office said that it conducted an operation in Longmont on June 20 to apprehend a child rapist, adding that it was disrupted by Rapid Response Network members.\n\nICE Denver declined to specify the way in which the Rapid Response Network interfered, and did not comment on whether there were any physical or verbal altercations between agents and network volunteers. ICE said on social media that the raid targeted a man from El Salvador who is wanted in Italy but has provided no warrant or other evidence to show that the raid was indeed focused on that man, or that he was in Longmont.\n\nIn a June 25 statement, DHS Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin said the network and its members \"disrupt ICE operations targeting dangerous criminal illegal aliens.\"\n\nJennifer Piper, a longtime leader in the Rapid Response Network, was dispatching calls on June 20. She said a group of volunteer confirmers drove to the Longmont location and talked to community members about their rights but did not confront or otherwise interfere with ICE.\n\n\"This (incident) invited hundreds of people to try to troll our hotline, which was unsuccessful,\" Piper said. \"But this is an administration that has put out a bunch of misinformation and propaganda. We are just trying to get the best information possible out to our community.\"\n\nCombating fear\n\nLane-Arellano said that documenting instances when ICE isn\'t present in a community is just as important as documenting when immigration agents are present. That\'s because fear has permeated throughout Colorado immigrant communities, and it\'s crucial to help her neighbors regain a level of security, she said.\n\nEvery white van or law enforcement uniform can signal potential ICE presence to people who fear deportation, especially due to ICE tactics of using unmarked vehicles and arresting many non-criminals, she added.\n\n\"We show people what\'s actually happening, and I think that\'s really valuable so that there\'s not needless fear,\" Lane-Arellano said. \"(ICE is) trying to silence that kind of work, and they want to criminalize that kind of work. I think people should be really concerned when there\'s a government entity that\'s just never held accountable, and is trying to minimize their public scrutiny.\"\n\nSome of the network\'s volunteers attended a July 7 protest calling for closure of the ICE detention center is Aurora, which is operated by private prison firm GEO Group. Vizguerra has been detained there for four months.\n\nVizguerra\'s daughter, Luna Báez, joined demonstrators. While protests and social media posts bring attention to the plight of detainees, Báez said allies of immigrants should also focus on other supportive steps -- such as donating to nonprofits, providing translation services and volunteering with the Rapid Response Network.\n\n\"It\'s all about direct action,\" Báez said. \"You have to get uncomfortable to dismantle these systems of oppression.\"\n\nDenver resident Deb Schaffer attended the protest and also volunteers as a confirmer with the network. So far, she has gone out on about eight calls.\n\n\"It\'s a way to support people in the immigrant community and have a way to be helpful, and it\'s a way to be someone that\'s proud to live in Colorado,\" Schaffer said. \"We\'re doing that together.\"\n\nVolunteering with the network can take a mental health toll, because of how intense and heartbreaking the calls can be, Lane-Arellano said. She remembers a 7 a.m. call she received from a Denver-area preschool principal who was concerned about ICE nearby and who said parents were too afraid to exit their cars with their children.\n\nThe network sent out a confirmer who verified that the sighting was actually a local law enforcement agency, and the confirmation that it was a false alarm helped the preschool return to normal.\n\nBut that call, and those terrified parents and kids, have stuck with Lane-Arellano.\n\n\"It can be painful, but I do it anyway because of the goodness of everyday people,\" Lane-Arellano said. \"When it feels like there\'s so much hate and cruelty at the federal level, it helps knowing that this isn\'t what we stand for, and knowing that there\'s so many people who are willing to put their own person on the line to support our community.\"\n\nSUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE', 'https://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/gjsentinel.com/content/tncms/custom/image/b32d0574-1b24-11ec-a31e-77e4d5ecaec6.jpg?resize=600%2C315', 'https://www.gjsentinel.com/news/colorado/a-volunteer-network-documents-ice-operations-across-colorado-here-s-how-it-works/article_57caa9ec-4d25-5778-86c1-bafd7373c85e.html', 'The Grand Junction Daily Sentinel', 'Delilah Brumer', 'dmoz/Society/Issues, dmoz/Society/Issues/Violence and Abuse, dmoz/Society/Crime/Theft, news/Politics', '2025-07-14 05:00:51', '2025-07-14 07:04:27', '2025-07-14 07:04:27'),

Over a candid revelation, he opened up about why Paani struck such a chord, how he balances life on both sides of the camera, and why, despite all the accolades, he feels he\'s only just begun.\n\nOn winning big with Paani\n\nHonestly, it\'s still sinking in. Paani was born out of genuine passion to tell relevant stories and from a place of real concern about something that affects so many lives. To see that story resonate with audiences was already the biggest reward for us. And then for it to be celebrated like this at Filmfare, with so many of our departments recognised, is deeply fulfilling. It feels like all the struggles and sleepless nights were worth it.\n\nI believe it was the honesty. We didn\'t set out to make a message heavy film or glamourise the issue. Water scarcity is a harsh, everyday reality for countless people, and we tried to portray it with empathy and respect. Also, the entire team gave it their all, from Priyanka, Madhu, my father, Siddharth, and every single person on set, there was utmost dedication to telling the story. There was so much heart poured into every frame by every single one, I think audiences can sense that sincerity.\n\nOn his next projects\n\nBoth are very different from Paani, which is what I love.
